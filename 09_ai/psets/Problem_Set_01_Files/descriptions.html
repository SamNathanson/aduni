Buck Best is an adminstrator who has returned to school to get an advanced 
degree.  He has taken no subjects yet; he wants to learn subjects by 
teaching them, and he especially wants to learn the material in 6AAA, 6DDD, 
or 6034.  He is believed to be of average intelligence, by the standards of 
MIT undergraduates.  His personality is unassuming.

John D. Slacker wants to be a management consultant when he graduates. 
Other than that, he isn't really interested in his research, nor in 
computer science for that matter.  He was a course 15 major.  He is 
considered as a TA only because he got an off scale recommendation from his 
Sloan UROP advisor, who describes his as brilliant.  He is especially eager 
to teach 6034, and likes to work.

Alyssa P. Hacker is the ultimate hard-core coder. She took 6FFF with 
the optional lab the same time she took 6III, and still complained 
that she didn't have enough opportunity to code.  Espresso was too 
decaffeinated for her in 6JJJ.  Interestingly enough, Alyssa is never 
wrong.  She wants to teach anything in which coding is emphasized.

Melissa P. Hacker is Alyssa P. Hacker's twin.  Her intelligence and wits

Thorbear Persson is from Sweden.  Thorbear really, really dislikes 
programming.  He struggled through 6AAA, and freezes in disgust at the very 
thought of such concepts as fixed-point analysis and meta-circular 
evaluation.  He would hate to be assigned a course that focuses on 
software, and even digital systems for that matter.  He has taught 6034, 
6AAA, and 6DDD in the past.  He likes work, but has a poor rating as a TA

Electra N. Etter lives in 38-500.  Flirtation with analog devices 
began soon after 6BBB, and blossomed into a full-blown love affair 
after 6BBB.  She wants to TA any subject in which circuits are likely to 
be stressed.  She has taught 6BBB and 6CCC.

Jack Grub did his undergraduate at Stanford, majoring in computer 
science.  He is a new Ph.D. student in LCS.  Not much is actually

supervisor, who characterized him as "exceptionally bright." 
He is lazy.

required. 
<p>

<hr>

in the subject.  Two TAs are preferred. 
<p>

<hr>
<p>

6CCC: The professor in charge prefers TAs who have had an A or B in the 
subject.  He requires TAs with an agressive personality. 
<p>

<hr>
<p>

6DDD: The professor in charge focuses on enthusiasm, and mainly has a 
preference for people who have indicated a preference for being a TA in the

a TA.  A total of two desired. 
<p>

<hr>
<p>
