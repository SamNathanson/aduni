<H1>Goals 
</H1>

<P>
The goal of this project is to develop&#151;through experience&#151;your 
ability to:

<UL>
<LI>Make technical choices. 
<LI>Predict system performance. 
</UL>

<H1>The General Message Sorting Problem 
</H1>

<P>
We all have too much to read: We are overwhelmed by material, both relevant 
and irrelevant. One version of the problem is the difficulty of even 
sorting articles into appropriate categories. We want you to develop 
software that will assist with this problem.

<P>
In its simplest form, you can imagine a training set of news articles, each 
of which is identified by its category. You are to devise a program that 
uses the training set to learn how to identify the category of subsequent 
articles.

<H1>The Specific Problem 
</H1>

<P>
International Conglomerates, Inc., is a huge multinational corporation that 
has virtual monopoly on a wide range of industries.

<P>
Presently, International Conglomerates has a central news center that 
receives news wires from all over the world.  A human editor reviews each 
incoming article and classifies it, so that it can be routed to the 
appropriate division.  Naturally, this is a very labor&#045;intensive and 
error&#045;prone task.  CEO Ima &#036;avage wonders if it is it possible to build a 
computer system to do the classification job automatically.

<P>
You have been hired as a high&#045;powered consultant to look into the problem. 
You soon determine that there are four divisions within International 
Conglomerates, each of which is interested in a particular category of 
news:

<TABLE CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1><TR><TD> 
<B>Division</B> </TD><TD><B>Category of interest</B> </TD><TD><B>Typical subjects</B> </TD></TR><TR><TD>
Conglomo&#045;Organic Division </TD><TD>organic </TD><TD>livestock, sugar, 
wheat, grain, tea, vegetable oil</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Conglomo&#045;Petrochemical Division </TD><TD>petrochemicals </TD><TD>crude oil, 
oil, natural gas, plastics, etc.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Conglomo&#045;Metals Division </TD><TD>metals </TD><TD>gold, silver, 
copper, tin, steel, etc.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Conglomo&#045;Finance Division </TD><TD>financial </TD><TD>bond/interest 
rates, stock market, money supply, etc. 
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
In order to help with your task, the Ms. &#036;avage has provided you with a 
corpus of old news articles and the divisions to which they were routed.

<P>
The corpus contains articles in the form suggested by the following samples. 
Evidently, the raw text has been prepared for digestion by a Scheme 
program:

<UL>
<LI>Each article is represented as a Scheme expression. 
<LI>The first element is a unique identification number. 
<LI>The second element contains the category determined by a human being. 
<LI>The third element contains a title. 
<LI>The fourth element contains a place followed by a month and a day. 
<LI>The fifth element contains the news. 
<LI>All punctuation has been replaced by special symbols, such as 
   <CODE>*comma*</CODE>, <CODE>*period*</CODE>, and <CODE>*dash*</CODE>. 
</UL>

<pre>
(0000 (financial) 
     (BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES IN EARLY TOKYO AFTERNOON) 
     (TOKYO *comma* April 1) 
(The Bank of Japan intervened in the market in the early afternoon *comma* 
 buying dollars around 147 *period* 30 yen and continuing to buy them as 
 high as 147 *period* 50 yen *comma* dealers said *period* The Bank 
 intervened just after the dollar started rising on buying by securities 
 houses at around 147 *period* 05 yen *comma* and hoped to accelerate the

 high as 147 *period* 50 yen *period* REUTER))

     (MALAYSIA CUTS GAZETTED RUBBER PRICE) 
     (KUALA LUMPUR *comma* April 1) 
(Malaysian government said it cut the gazetted price of rubber to 202 *dash* 7/8 cents 
 per kg from 213 *dash* 1/2 cents in March *comma* effective immediately 
 *period* No export duty is applicable at this level *comma* against 3/8 
 cent per kg last month *comma* because the government raised the export 
 duty threshold price to 210 cents per kg in early 1985 *period* The cess 
 for rubber research and replanting remained unchanged at 3 *period* 85 and 
 9 *period* 92 cents per kg respectively *period* REUTER))

<H1>Your job 
</H1>

<P>
After discussion with Ms. &#036;avage, you agree to write a program that learns 
to classify such articles on the basis of their content.  That is, you are 
to write a program that uses the given corpus of human&#045;categorized articles 
to learn to recognize articles that are not categorized.

<P>
In particular, given a test file containing articles with empty category 
expressions, your program will write a file in which each articles is 
represented as a two&#045;element list containing an identification number and 
one of four categories, <CODE>ORGANIC</CODE>, <CODE>PETRO</CODE>, <CODE>METAL</CODE>, or 
<CODE>FINANCIAL</CODE>.  Thus, if the articles in the sample set were 
provided as a test set, with empty category expressions, your program is to 
write a file containing the following:

<pre>
(0000 FINANCIAL) 
(0001 ORGANIC) 
</pre>

<P>
More precisely, you agree to:

<UL>
<LI>Select a learning approach. 
<LI>Implement a program based on that approach. 
<LI>Test your implemented program. 
<LI>Forecast how well your impementated program will work on subsequent articles. 
</UL>

<P>
Your approach and implementation should handle categories, training  
   data, and test sets in general, not just those of interest to  
   International Conglomerates.  If we were to change the categories,  
   training data, and test sets, your approach and implementation should  
   still work.  Thus, you are not to manually tune your program to the  
   particular categories provided.
