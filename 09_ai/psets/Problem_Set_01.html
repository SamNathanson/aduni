<H1>Goals 
</H1>

<P>
The goal of this project is to develop&#151;through experience&#151;your 
ability to:

<UL>
<LI>Make technical choices. 
<LI>Bring multiple ideas together to solve a problem. 
<LI>See how one problem can serve as a precedent for the solution of another. 
<LI>Deal with problems that have less specification than that typical of a problem set. 
<LI>Organize and perform work with a partner. 
<LI>Write about your work. 
</UL>

<H1>The Resource&#045;Allocation Problem 
</H1>

<P>
Resource allocation is an often&#045;difficult, real&#045;world problem.  One version 
of the problem is the personnel allocation problem: you have people with 
various qualifications and preferences, jobs with various requirements and 
preferences, and a need to assign the people to the jobs intelligently.

<P>
One such problem is the assignment of TAs to subjects.  In its simplest 
form, you can imagine a set of subjects, each of which requires one TA, and 
a set of potential TAs, each of which can be assigned to zero or one 
subject.

<P>
You could think of this as a search problem, with depth <I>s</I> and 
branching factor <I>t</I>.  You could think of solving the search problem 
by doing a British Museum search; that is, you could generate all possible 
paths and then evaluate each.  Alas, even with just 10 subjects and 15 TA 
candidates, a British&#045;Museum enumeration of assignments unthinkable, which 
you should show yourself, if in doubt, on the back of an envelope.

<H1>What you start with 
</H1>

<P>
Accordingly, you will need to do some other sort of search.  We provide you 
with a <a href="./">starting point</a> in the 
form of a program cum data set and rule set with the following 
characteristics:

<UL>
<LI>The search done is depth&#045;first search. 
<LI>Node expansion is done by a rule&#045;based system. 
<LI>There is sample database of a few assertions and one sample rule. 
<LI>The assumption is that no subject requires more than one TA. 
</UL>

<H1>Your job 
</H1>

<P>
We provide you with a set of <a href="Problem_Set_01_Files/descriptions.html">subject and TA descriptions</a>. 
In particular, you are to do the following:

<UL>
<LI>Develop a set of assertions from the subject and TA descriptions.  You 
   must decide what to make use of in the descriptions and what to ignore: 
   we expect you to capture some details of description only approximately 
   or not at all. 
<LI>Develop a set of rules using commonsense and the subject and TA 
   descriptions. 
<LI>Choose and implement a search strategy. 
<LI>Choose and implement a mechanism for determining the quality of a 
   particular TA assignment. 
</UL>

<P>
You may be able to find a solution for the sample data by hand.  Keep in 
mind that the goal is not only to find a solution for the sample data, but 
also to write a program that can handle similar problems, of approximately 
the same number of TAs and subjects, with, for example, other, more, or 
fewer preferences and requirements.

<P>
Also, your program is to scale, for example, to ten times more TAs and 
subjects.

<H1>Important Notes 
</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Your program is to distinguish between <B>requirements</B> and 
   <B>preferences</B>:  requirements cannot be violated; preferences can 
   be, but the quality of a set of TA assignments declines in proportion to 
   the number and sign of violated preferences. 
<LI>Your program is to do the best it can with more TAs than TA assignments, 
   just the right number, or not enough TAs for the available TA assignments. 
<LI>You are to assume each subject has a requirement for just one TA.  We 
   will ask you to comment on what you would need to do to generalize to 
   multiple TAs per subject.
