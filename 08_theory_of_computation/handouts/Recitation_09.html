 Recitation 9, 05/15/01 </h2></center>

<h2>Topics</h2>
<ul>
<li>How many languages are there? 
<li>Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata.
<li>Deterministic Pushdown Automata.
<li>Converting Context Free Grammars to Pushdown Automata.
</ul>

<h2> Problems to work on </h2>
<ol>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<li> Could I ever write a computer program that enumerated (listed)
all the possible languages? What about one that enumerated all the
regular languages?  What about one that enumerated all the
context-free languages?


<h2>Pushdown Automata Warmup</h2>

<li> What is the difference between a Nondeterministic Pushdown
Automaton and a Deterministic Pushdown Automaton. Do you think they
generate the same languages?


<li> (Warm up) Construct a PDA that accepts the language {0,1}*.


<li> (Warm up from last time:) Construct a PDA that accepts the language
{0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n >= 0}. Is your answer deterministic or not?

<li> Construct a PDA that accepts the language
{0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n >= 2}. 

<h2>More Pushdown Automata </h2>

<li> Construct a PDA that accepts the language 
{ 0<sup>m</sup>1<sup>n</sup> |  n > m >= 0}

<li> (From last time:) Construct a PDA that accepts the language
{0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>m</sup>0<sup>m</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n,m >= 0}.

<li> Construct a PDA that accepts the language { w | w is not a palindrome} 

<h2>And/Or</h2>

<li> Construct a PDA that accepts the language { w | w is not a palindrome and w ends with a zero}

<li> Give a PDA that accepts the language  {a<sup>i</sup> b<sup>j</sup> | i <= j <= 2i}

<h2> Deterministic vs Nondeterministic PDA's</h2>

<li>  Construct a NPDA that accepts the language of strings with
the same number of zeros and ones.

<li>  Construct a DPDA that accepts the language of strings with 
the same number of zeros and ones.


<h2>Converting Grammars to PDA's</h2>


<li>Convert the following Grammar to a PDA.

<pre>
S --> AB
A -->  0
B -->  1
</pre>




<li>Convert the following Grammar to a PDA.

<pre>

A --> BAB | B | epsilon
B --> 00 | espilon

</pre>
