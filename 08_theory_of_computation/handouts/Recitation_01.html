<h2>Topics</h2>
<ul>
<li> Languages
<li> All computational problems can be reframed as questions
of membership in a language (set).
<li> Drawing Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs).
<li> Drawing Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFAs).
<li> Converting NFAs to DFAs
<li> Regular Languages, Closure properties of Regular languages.
</ul>

<h2> Problems to work on </h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>What is a language?
<li>Draw a DFA that accepts the strings ending in 01.
<li>Draw a DFA that accepts the strings that have an even number of zeros.
<li>Draw a DFA that accepts the strings that have an even number of zeros
or end in 01.
<li>Draw a DFA that accepts the strings that have an even number of zeros
and end in 01.
<li>Draw a DFA that accepts the strings that have an even number of zeros
but don't end in 01.
<li>Draw an NFA that accepts the strings that end in 01. Try to make it
as simple as possible.
<li>Draw an NFA that accepts the strings that have an even number of zeros
or end in 01 using six states.
<li>Draw an NFA that accepts any string that is a concatenation of a string
that has an even number of zeros with a string that ends in 01.
<li>Draw an NFA that accepts the strings that have an even number of zeros
and end in 01.
<li>Draw an NFA that accepts the language 0, using only two states.
<li>Convert the previous NFA into a DFA using the method described in class.
<li>Draw an NFA with two states that corresponds to the language  0?2*.
<li>Convert the previous NFA to a DFA.
<li>What is a regular language?
<li>Draw the DFA that corresponds to the language 10*10*.
<li>What is the Prefix of the language corresponding to the language 10*10*.
<li>Draw the DFA for the prefix of the language corresponding to the
regular expression 10*10*.
<li>What is the MIN of the language 10*10*?
<li>Draw the DFA corresponding to the MIN of the language 10*10*.
