<h2>Main Topics</h2>
<ul>
<li> More practice with NFAs, Converting to DFAs, getting rid of epsilons.
<li> Formal defintion of Automata <br>
     The math mumbo-jumbo formulation is:
     Some five-tuple (Q, Sigma, delta, q, F).... <br>
     But that's not as bad as it seems. This is
     just some object that contains four other objects
     and a method. Which one is the method?
<li> Operations on Languages:
     Our friends PREFIX and MIN
<li> An example Proof. Just so you have a reference, we'll show you how to "prove"
     that Regular languages are closed under difference, ie. L1-L2 is regular if
     L1 and L2 are.
<pre>
       Let M1 = (Q1, Sigma, delta1, q1, F1) accept L1, and let
       Let M2 = (Q2, Sigma, delta2, q2, F2) accept L2
       Then
       M = (Q1xQ2, Sigma, delta, (q1,q2), F1 x(Q2-F2)) accepts L1-L2
       where  delta(r1,r2,a) = (delta1(r1,a), delta2(r2,a))
</pre>       At this point you should give a few words of justification
       about why you think this new machine would accept L1-L2.
       If the mathematical notation
       is just way to much for you, just try to explain things in
       intuitively.

<li> Regular expressions
</ul>
<h3>If we run out of things to talk about :-)</h3>
<ul>
<li> Generalized NFAs <br>
     NFA + reg. ex. transitions = GNFA
<li> Converting NFAs to Regular expressions
<li> Converting Regular expressions to NFAs
</ul>

<h2> Problems to work on </h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Write out the NFA corresponding to the language and convert to a DFA:
     All strings that end in 0.
<li> Same for all strings whose penultimate character is 0.
<li> If you like this sort of thing: same things for all strings that
that have 0 as the third to the last character.
<li> One more if you'd like the practice: All strings ending in {0,1}

<li>
 Write out the NFA corresponding to this state/transition table:
<pre>
             0            1
->p        {p,q}         {p}
  q         {r}          {r}
  r         {s}           {}
 *s         {s}          {s}
</pre>
Here the star means we have an accept state
<li> Write regular expressions for all strings that end in
     aaba. Where Sigma is just the usual alphabet.
<li> Do the same for all  strings that do not contain a.
<li> Write a regular expression for the strings that contain the substring 0101,
     where Sigma = {0,1}.
<li> Do the same for all strings that alternate between 0 and 1 and end in 0.
<li> Do the same for strings that alternate between 0 and 1.
<li> Hard problem: Write  a regular expression for the strings over {0,1} that 
are divisible
     by 3.
<li> Hard Problem: Build an automaton that recognizes the strings that have the
 same number of
zeros and ones. </ol>
