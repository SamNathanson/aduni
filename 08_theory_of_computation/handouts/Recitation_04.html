<h2> Problems to work on </h2>

<li> Why do we care about minimizing DFA's ? 

<li> Minimize the following DFA. What Language does it generate?

<li> Give a regular grammar that generates the same language as the
DFA in problem 2.         

<li> Give a regular grammars that generates the same language as the
following regular expressions:
  <ol type=a>
    <li> 010*
    <li> a(ab + bc)*
  </ol>


<li> Is the following a valid argument? Why or why not? The language L
= {0<sup>m</sup>1<sup>m</sup> 2<sup>n</sup> | m, n >= 0 } is not
regular, since we already know that M = { 0<sup>m</sup> 1<sup>m</sup>
| m >= 0} is not regular by the pumping lemma, and since L contains
M it cannot therefore be regular.

<li> Prove that the language { x<sup>2<sup>n</sup></sup> | n >= 0 } is not
regular.

<li> Give a decision algorithm which takes as input a regular language
L and decides whether L contains the string 1000101.


<li> Give a decision algorithm which takes as input a regular language
L and decides whether L equals the language  {1000101}


<li> Give a decision algorithm which takes as input a regular language
L and decides whether L contains the language given by the regular
expression 10*10*1

<li> Miscellaneous problem: Eliminate the espilon transitons of this
NFA, without converting it to a DFA (ie, figure out an easier way)

<li> Mildy Challenging and Surprising Problem: Let L be any language
over the alphabet {0}, not necessarily regular. Show that L* is
regular.

<li> Wicked hard challenging problem: Describe a grammar
that generates the language { 0<sup>p</sup> | p is a prime }
