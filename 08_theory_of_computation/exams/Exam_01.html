<ol>


<li>	<font size=+1>Finite State Machines.</font> (15 points)<p>

	Consider the following NFA over the alphabet {0,1}:
	<blockquote><img src="Exam_01_Files/1.gif"></blockquote>
 
	<ol type=a>
	<li>	Convert this NFA to a minimal DFA.
	<li>	Write a regular expression for the set the machine accepts.
	<li>	Write a linear grammar where each right side is of the form aB or a.<br>
	(“a” a terminal and “B” a non-terminal) to generate the set.
	</ol><p>

<li>	<font size=+1>More Machines.</font> (5 points)<p>

	Draw a finite state machine that accepts the complement of the language accepted by the non-deterministic machine below:
	<blockquote><img src="Exam_01_Files/2.gif"></blockquote>


<li>	<font size=+1>Regular or Not, Here I Come.</font> (15 points)<p>

Determine and prove for each set below whether it is Regular or not.  Be careful.<p>
 
	<ol type=a>
	<li>	The set of all strings in which every third symbol is the same as the first symbol in the string.
	<li>	The set 1<sup>m</sup>0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>m+n</sup>, for m and n greater than or equal to one.
	<li>	The set of strings where each string has an equal number of 0’s and 1’s, and every prefix of the string has at most one more 0 than 1, and at most one more 1 than 0.
 	</ol><p>


<li>	<font size=+1>Closure.</font> (10 points)<p>

Determine whether Regular sets are closed under each of the operations below.  Prove your answers by an explanation and/or example or counterexample.<p>

	<ol type=a>
	<li>	Even(L) is the set of all strings x in L such that |x| is even. 
	<li>	Triple(L) = {x | x=uvw, such that u, v, w are in L, and |u| = |v| = |w|}.
	</ol><p>

<li>	<font size=+1>Decision Algorithms.</font> (5 points)<p>

Give a decision algorithm to determine whether a regular language L1 has one or more strings in common with the language described by the regular expression [00 + 11 + (01 + 10)(00 + 11)*(01 + 10)]*.<p>
