<ol>

<li>	<font size=+1>Finite State Machines.</font> (15 points)<p>

	Consider the following NFA over the alphabet {0,1}:
	<blockquote><img src="Exam_01_Files/1.gif"></blockquote>
 
	<ol type=a>
	<li>	Convert this NFA to a minimal DFA.<p><img src="Exam_01_Files/1a-ans.gif"><p>

	<li>	Write a regular expression for the set the machine accepts.<p>
		<b><tt>[0+(0+1)(1+00)*01]*(0+1)(1+00)*</tt></b><p>

	<li>	Write a linear grammar where each right side is of the form aB or a.<p>
		<b><tt>	A -> 0A | 0B | 1B<br>B -> 1B | 0C | e<br>C -> 0B | 1A</tt></b><p>

	</ol><p>

<li>	<font size=+1>More Machines.</font> (5 points)<p>

	Draw a finite state machine that accepts the complement of the language accepted by the non-deterministic machine below:

<li>	<font size=+1>Regular or Not, Here I Come.</font> (15 points)<p>

Determine and prove for each set below whether it is Regular or not.  Be careful.<p>
 
	<ol type=a>
	<li>	The set of all strings in which every third symbol is the same as the first symbol in the string.<p>
		<b>REGULAR</b>. This language can be accepted by the following NFA:<br><img src="Exam_01_Files/3a-ans.gif"><p>

	<li>	The set 1<sup>m</sup>0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>m+n</sup>, for m and n greater than or equal to one.<p>
		<b>NOT REGULAR</b> by the pumping lemma. Let p be the pumping length and consider the string s=1<sup>p</sup>0<sup>p</sup>1<sup>2p</sup>. Now we try to break it up into s=xyz. Since |xy|<=p and |y|>0, y can only contain 1s. When we pump the string once we get xy<sup>2</sup>z = 1<sup>p+|y|</sup>0<sup>p</sup>1<sup>2p</sup> which is not in the language. This contradicts the pumping lemma, so the language is not regular.<p>

	<li>	The set of strings where each string has an equal number of 0’s and 1’s, and every prefix of the string has at most one more 0 than 1, and at most one more 1 than 0.<p>
		<b>REGULAR</b>. This language can be accepted by the following NFA:<br><img src="Exam_01_Files/3c-ans.gif"><p>

 	</ol><p>


<li>	<font size=+1>Closure.</font> (10 points)<p>

Determine whether Regular sets are closed under each of the operations below.  Prove your answers by an explanation and/or example or counterexample.<p>

	<ol type=a>
	<li>	Even(L) is the set of all strings x in L such that |x| is even.<p>
		<b>CLOSED</b> Even(L) is just the intersection of L with a DFA which accepts strings of even length. Since L and this DFA are both regular, and regular sets are closed under intersection, regular sets must also be closed under Even.<p>


	<li>	Triple(L) = {x | x=uvw, such that u, v, w are in L, and |u| = |v| = |w|}.<p>
		<b>NOT CLOSED</b> by counterexample. Consider the language A = 0*1. Triple(A) has the form 0<sup>n</sup>10<sup>n</sup>10<sup>n</sup>1 where n>=0. If we assume pumping length p and try to pump the string s=0<sup>p</sup>10<sup>p</sup>10<sup>p</sup>1 which is in this language, we get s=0<sup>p+|y|</sup>10<sup>p</sup>10<sup>p</sup>1 which is not. Since A is regular and Triple(A) is not, the set of regular languages is not closed under Triple.<p>

	</ol><p>

<li>	<font size=+1>Decision Algorithms.</font> (5 points)<p>

Give a decision algorithm to determine whether a regular language L1 has one or more strings in common with the language described by the regular expression [00 + 11 + (01 + 10)(00 + 11)*(01 + 10)]*.<p>

<ol>
<li>Obtain a DFA for L1
<li>Obtain a DFA for the regular expression [00 + 11 + (01 + 10)(00 + 11)*(01 + 10)]*
<li>Intersect the two DFAs.
<li>If the result accepts anything, accept; Otherwise reject.
