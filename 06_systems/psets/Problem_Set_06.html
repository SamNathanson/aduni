<h4>Due in Recitation on 3/8/2001:</h4>

<li> Finish reading <i>Scalable Transport for Transparent
Mobile Internetworking</i>.  

Your writing/discussion assignment:

<blockquote>
Mobile IP is a store and forward-like protocol that enables a computer
on the network to change IP addresses transparently.  The protocol is
backwards compatible with IP, but requires the presence of agents on
the network.  In particular, a home agent is required, but a foreign
agent is not.  Foreign agents, however, appear to add some overhead
(e.g., one or more extra network hops to the mobile host).  Give at
least one circumstance where having a foreign host would actually
improve communication performance, despite the additional hop(s)
required.  (Hint: Consider a video stream or a large file being sent
to a mobile host, and think about how mobile networks differ from
wired networks in terms of bandwidth, latency, and reliability)
<br><br>

Bonus questions: Why do you think that Mobile IP is not in widespread
use today?
</blockquote>

<li> Read <i>The Click Modular Router</i>. This is a very techinical
read (a la sections I-IV of the RAID paper).  Approach this paper by
determining what problem the authors are trying to solve (In the
Abstract and Introduction).  Notice that the top of page 265 outlines
what each subsequent chapter is about.  A quick skim shows that the
architecture section describes the key approaches being used to solve
the problem.  Given how technical this paper is, focusing on the
architecture section will probably give you the best ratio of
understanding per time spent. Skimming the rest of the paper is a good
idea.  Anything more than skimming will take a lot of time, since
really understanding all the details would require a huge amount of
background.  Sometime in the future, if/when you are a network wizard,
you will have read enough of this paper to know when you should come
back to get the rest of the story.
