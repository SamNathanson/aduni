<h2>Assignment handed out on Thursday, March 1, 2001</h2>
<ul>
<h4>Due in Recitation on 3/1/2001:</h4>

<li> From the paper <a
href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/docs/articles/good-news/good-news.html"><i>Lisp:
Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big</i></a>, read the short section <a
href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/docs/articles/good-news/subsection3.2.1.html"><i>Worse
is Better</i></a>.  Be prepared to discuss the following in
recitation:

<blockquote>
Scheme is listed as a language that followed the "MIT Approach".  As
you may or may not know, some companies do use Scheme in commercial
applications.  An unnamed local robotics company is one.  Another
example is Ariba's business to business exchange core engine (but
don't expect them to admit it!).  This seems to debunk Gabriel's
argument, or does it?  Take a side, and be prepared to support and
defend your position.  You may extend or modify Garbriel's argument if
you wish.
</blockquote>
<h4> Due in Recitation Friday, March 2, 2001</h4>

<li> Read <i>The Science of Scientific Writing</i>.  Use those
guidelines in all writing assignments in the class.  You are also
encouraged to read what MIT thinks are <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/2000/www/reports.html">good examples of
1 pagers</a> from previous students in MIT's systems class.

<li> Read <i>Lucky's Bozos on the bus</i>.  Make a list of the 2-3
points the paper makes, and be prepared to support and defend your
choices in recitation.

<li> Read the <i>Architecture of Complexity</i>.  Prepare a 1-page
discussion around the following:
<blockquote>
Earlier in the year, you learned how to manage complexity via
Abstraction.  Simon argues that Hierarchy should be used to manage
complexity.  Discuss how you would use Abstraction and a Hierarchy in
managing complexity.  Make sure you cover the pros and cons of your
approach.  To organize your thoughts, it may be helpful to think about
these four approaches: Abstraction only, a Hierarchy only, both, and
neither.<br><br>

If it helps, you may give examples of how you used (or could have
used) your approach in the Gnutella Java client you wrote.  For this
assignment, you may include 1 extra page of (summarized) code or a
figure to illustrate your points.

</blockquote>

<h4>By March 11, 2001</h4>
<ul>
<li> Read <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>.  This will be covered in the Quiz,
and will also help your team during the Survivor: aD Uni contest
