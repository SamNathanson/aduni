Come prepared with at least an outline of your aD Uni Survivor paper
and an outline of your talk.  Members of the teaching staff will be
available from 1PM-3PM (or later) to give you feedback - e.g., listen
to a practice talk, critique your synthesis and analysis, ensure you
are not doing too much or too little, make you stronger faster and
better.

<h4>Due in Recitation, Monday, March 19</h4>

<li> Read Chapter 14 in the text, focusing on Coda and on replication
for transactions.  Read <i>Disconnected Operation in the Coda File
System</i>.  Your assignment:

<blockquote>
You previously recommended a file system for a new, fast-moving, small
software company.  You chose from NFS, AFS, and Echo.  Suppose this
company installed a wireless network, and wanted to support
disconnected operation.  Would you recommend Coda?  If so, explain
why.  If not, explain why, and suggest at least one approach to
changing Coda that addresses your key concern(s).  As before, make
sure you identify your assumptions.
