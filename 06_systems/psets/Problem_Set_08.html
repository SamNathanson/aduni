<h4>Due in Recitation, Monday 3/12</h4>

<li> Read <i>Reflections on Trust</i>.  Suppose you download a free,
open-source implementation of PGP (a program that can be used to
encrypt/decrypt data).  You examine every line of code and come to the
conclusion that the code "does the right thing".  You compile and run
the program.  Later on, you find that your compiled code was actually
sending your private keys out to the Internet.  Be able to explain how
this could be.

<li> Skim <i>Why Cryptosystems Fail</i>.  Identify several hints for
building more secure systems.
