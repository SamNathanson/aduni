<ul>
<h4>Due in Recitation on 3/9/2001:</h4>

<li>From the textbook, read Chapter 9 on naming.  Skim over the case
studies, focusing on DNS.

Your writing/discussion assignment:

<blockquote>
DNS and Grapevine have different models for maintaining the
consistency of name information.  In particular, DNS is more lax about
consistency than Grapevine.  Do you think it would be a better idea to
use Grapevine for name resolution on the Internet instead of DNS?
Take a side and discuss.  If you prefer, base your answer using the
framework below.  <br><br>

Consider the scenario where a network administrator enters the wrong
IP address for aduni.org into a root, authoritative DNS server just
before that IP address is propagated to a set of non-authoritative
servers.  Contrast this to a scenario where an administrator enters a
wrong address while updating GrapevineRServer under the Grapevine
system.  Assume the administrator does not realize the address being
entered is wrong.<br><br>

Think about how the error might propagate throughout the network.
Consider how long it would take to rectify the error in each scenario.
Don't forget to consider the tradeoffs - you rarely get something for
nothing.
