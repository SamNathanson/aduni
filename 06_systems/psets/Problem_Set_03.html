<h4>Due in Recitation on 3/5/2001:</h4>

<i><b>I've included a link to the UNIX paper below, in case your copy,
like mine, was missing pages</b></i><br><br>

<li> Read <i>Virtual Memory for an Object-Oriented Language</i>.  For
recitation, come prepared with a 5 minute summary of the paper (i.e.,
what problem is being solved, what approach is being used, ...)

<li> Read <i>Disk System Architectures for High-Performance
Computing</i>.  For recitation, come prepared with a 5 minute summary
of the paper (i.e., what problem is being solved, what approach is
being used, ...)  Make sure you understand the different RAID levels
(e.g., assumptions, objectives, tradeoffs)

<li> Read the classic <a
href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/cacm.html"><i>The UNIX
Time-Sharing System</i></a>. Your writing/discussion assignment:

<blockquote>
The decision to base all UNIX I/O around a stream-based model was
based partially on the assumption that most devices were sequential
and that programs would have a 16-bit memory address space.  If
Ritchie and Thomas instead designed UNIX with systems such as the <i>X
Window System</i> in mind, how might their I/O design be different?
Would you want the same kind of I/O for files and devices?  Take a
side and defend it.  Give at least one concrete and convincing example
of why stream-based I/O may or may not be appropriate for bit-mapped
displays (e.g., running X).<br><br> Clue: Think about the I/O needed
to move windows on a bit-mapped display.
