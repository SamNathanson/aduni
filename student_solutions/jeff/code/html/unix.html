<center><h1>Using Unix Effectively</h1></center>
<p></p>

<!-- introduction  -->
<h1>Introduction</h1>
Unix is a very powerful tool.  It was made by programmers for
themselves to use, and as a result tends to be fast, configurable,
extremely powerful.  It also can be decidedly daunting for
beginners, as it was not designed with beginners in mind.  
By talking about some of the basics of the Unix philosophy
and building blocks of the Unix system and programs, we hope to give
you motivation to explore the full power and richness of the system.

<a name = "philosophy"><h1>The Unix Philosophy</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>Take the time to find the most efficient way to do something.
<li>Automate tedium.
<li>Don't reinvent the wheel unless you want to.
<li>Use all the resources available to find answers to your questions.
</ul>

For a longer description of the Unix philosophy, look at Eric Raymond's <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/taoup/chapter1.html"> The Art of Unix Programming</a>

<!-- shells section here  -->
<a name = "shells"><h1>Shells</h1></a>
A shell is a program which takes user input and passes it on to the
operating system.  Unix gives you a choice in shells (or write your
own!). A few different shells:
<ul>
<li><i>csh</i>, C shell
<li><i>ksh</i>, Korn shell
<li><i>bash</i>, Bourne again shell (default on our system)
</ul>
<h4>What does the shell do for you?</h4>
At the basic level a shell allows you to navigate the file system and run
programs. It can also be programmed, allowing you to automate and
script things.

<blockquote>
<h4>A simple shell script</h4>
This script will take a file, make a backup copy, and then open the
file in Emacs. 
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# edit -- example shell script

cp $1 $1.bak             # make a copy. $1 is the first command line variable
emacs $1                 # start emacs 
</pre>

Change the permission, allowing the file to the executed, and put it
in your path directory, and you've got a working program.

<h4>But what's a path?</h4>
The path is a list of places that the shell looks when you ask it to
run a program.
<pre>
[jeff@localhost jeff]$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/opt/home/jeff/bin:/usr/java/jdk1.3/bin/:/opt/home/jeff/lib:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games
</pre>

</blockquote>

<!-- permissions section here  -->
<a name = "permissions"><h1>Permissions</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>Three kinds of permissions: <b>read</b>, <b>write</b> and
<b>execute</b>
<li>Three levels of permissions: <b>user</b>, <b>group</b> and <b>global</b> 
</ul>
To see permissions for a file, use <code>ls -l</code>:
<pre>
      [jeff@localhost jeff]$ ls -l edit 
      -rw-r--r--    1 jeff     students           33 Mar  1 09:27 edit
</pre>
</blockquote>
These permissions do not apply to <code>root</code>, who has complete and unrestricted access to every file in the system. 

<!-- filesystem section here  -->
<a name = "filesys"><h1>Getting Around a Unix Filesystem</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>It's a tree.
<li>Everything is a file.
<li>Things are stored according to function. A few examples:
<ul>
<li><code>/bin</code> Binary (executable files)
<li><code>/doc</code> Documentation
<li><code>/usr</code> User added files
<li><code>/src</code> Source code
<li><code>/etc</code> Configuration files
</ul>
<li>Symbolic links are like shortcuts, they create a weak link from
one point in the file tree to another. Let's say there is a
directory <code>~/code/java/ps2/prob2/src/</code>, and you don't want
to type it in every time you go there.
A symbolic link can be created.
<blockquote>
<code>bash$ ln -s ~/code/java/ps2/prob2/src current</code>
</blockquote>
Now <code>current</code> is a symbolic link to the same place.
</ul>

<!-- pipes and redirect section here  -->
<a name = "pipes_redir"><h1>Pipes and Redirects</h1></a>
Unix makes it easy to use the output of one program as the input of
another. Combine this with the fact that everything in the system is a
file, and you have some powerful options.

A few examples of pipes:
<ul>
<li>ps aux | grep jeff
<li>cat file.java | lpr
<li>who | cut -c1-8 | sort -u | pr -l1 -8 -w78 -t
</ul>

<!-- cool programs  section here  -->
<a name = "cool_programs"><h1>A Few Cool Programs</h1></a>
Most Unix programs are run via a command line interface. Here is the
standard syntax:
<code>command flags input output</code>
<ul>
<li><code>chmod</code>
<li><code>chown</code>
<li><code>ps</code>
<li><code>grep</code>
<li><code>find</code>
<li><code>whoami</code>
<li><code>true</code>
<li><code>cal</code>
</ul>

<!-- help starts here -->
<a name = "help"><h1>Where to get help</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>Search engines
<li>How-to and mini how-to
<li>Online manuals
<li><code>apropos</code>
<li><code>man</code> pages
<li><code>info</code> pages
<li>Unix folk you know
</ul>

<!-- troubleshooting section here  -->
<a name = "trouble"><h1>Troubleshooting</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>Use your problem to give you a better understanding of the system.
<li>Document your solution, for yourself and others.
<li>Chances are your problem is not a unique one. If it is, you are lucky!
</ul>
