objects

ball
	color
		int color (BLUE = 0 ; RED  = 1 ; GREEN = 2)
	neighbors
		int[] neighbors (NORTH = 0, EAST = 1; SOUTH = 2 ; WEST
	= 3)

	each ball will have an actionListener that will let it know
	to either look for its neighbors and highlight itself
	or send a message to the board saying it wants to remove
	itself

	A search routine (breadh first tree search, perhaps with
	multithreading?) will be the most complicated issue in this.



board
	15 x 10 board
		int[][] board
		pieces will be 30 x 30
	keeps track of what is in a square at a given time
	takes care of compressing
	sends results to score

  perhaps inner classes:
	compressor
	score
