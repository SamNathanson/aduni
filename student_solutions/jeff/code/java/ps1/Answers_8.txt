ANSWERS TO PROBLEM 8

Java does not like it at all when I try to insert Integers and Strings
into the same PQueue, let alone remove them! This is not a very good
thing at all, and such an abstraction is not a good thing. Using a
TreeMap should solve these problems, as the Comparator in the TreeMap
can be taught to deal with variance of type.
