PROBLEM 6 ANSWERS

Inheiritance is a wonderful thing when there are a great many methods
that are to be shared among a large number of classes.  It doesn't
work quite so well when implementations are needing to be changed
often among children classes; in this case interfaces work much
better. Also, classes can use many different interfaces, while only
inheirited class can be used.  I think a combination of the two can
produce effective use of code.
