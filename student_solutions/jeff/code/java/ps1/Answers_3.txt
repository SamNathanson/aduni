QUESTIONS FOR PROBLEM 3

The advantages of using static methods for a unary method like scale()
lie in the fact that the original class object is not altered in any
way, which is very useful in many cases where one wants to use
something to produce a great number of results from one bit of input. 

This can also be seen as a disadvantage in circumstances where one
does not need to keep old values around, but would rather mutator the
current object. If object grow very large, this could also become a
memory/processor time issue as well.

Static methods allow for uninstantiated access which is very often a
useful thing. In many cases it does not make sense to have to create
an instance of a class in order to use its methods (such as having to
create a SinFunc object in order to gain its functionality). The
downside of using static functions is that changes to particular
classes are much more difficult to make, and sometimes an operation
needs to rely on non-static methods.
