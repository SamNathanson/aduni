Welcome to our lovely source tree! =)

This file is mostly for testing purposes, but it is probably not such
a bad idea to talk about a few neat CVS commands.

From the command line, you can add a new file to CVS with

bash$ cvs add <filename>

You can also register a file with CVS in emacs with "m-x vc-register"
Also, you can checkin the file you're working with using the command
"c-x c-q".

Let's rock it! -JMR
