README for Space Monkeys game

# Monkeys software Copyright 2001 by Kevin B. Smith
#     Released under GPL 2.0
# Original Space Monkeys game rules (C) 1999 Stephen Glenn,

This game is based on rules created by Stephen Glenn, which can 
be found at: http://pages.about.com/pbemesis/spacemonkeys.html

At this time, Monkeys differs from the original rules as follows:
- The computer automatically places all planets
- Players do not start with a ship (you must build it yourself)
- No technologies are available
- There is no limit to the number of ships of each type that a 
  player can have at the same time
- Planet values are not revealed until the planet has been 
  successfully colonized

Planet value is indicated by the shape of the planet. A full 
circle is a home planet, worth 5 victory points. A 3/4 circle 
is worth 3, semi-circle is worth 2, and a quarter-circle is 
worth 1.

Planet ownership is indicated by a horizontal color band. Ships 
are shown as a vertical bar, in the color of their owner. For 
more information on a planet or ship, do a left mouse click on 
the square they occupy.

The human player is always red, and the computer plays the three 
other colors. Each turn, you must select a command and press the 
OK button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. If you 
attempt an illegal move, nothing will happen.

The Build command requires you to choose a ship type. Once you 
have started building a ship of a certain type, you cannot change 
types until that ship has been completed and launched.

The Launch and Defense commands require you to select one of the 
planets that you own. To select a planet, first highlight it by 
left-clicking the mouse on that planet. Then press the "Select" 
button in the planet section of the command window.

The Colonize, Invade, Move, and Attack commands require you to 
select one of your ships. The Move and Attack commands also 
require you to specify a direction.

To select a ship, first highlight it by left-clicking the mouse 
on that ship. Then press the "Select" button in the ship section 
of the command window.

If you have multiple ships, be careful to select the correct 
ship before you press OK. Particularly after a new ship is 
launched, it is easy to move the wrong ship.

The computer will automatically detect when a player has lost or 
won. However, it will not automatically close the game window 
or bring up a dialog. It will print a message on the console 
that was used to launch the game. Illegal moves are also shown 
on that console.
