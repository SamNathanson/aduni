OK, here are two, actually:
 www.andreasen.org is one, he has sponsored a "16k MUD" programming 
 competiton and one of the muds is Java, others are written in Python, Perl, 
 C, etc.
 www.wolfmud.org is the other, HUGE code base from what I can see, I dl'ed it 
 at home and it had lots of classes already coded in there. Some definite 
 limitations do exist however (you can't go northeast, southeast, etc. 
 movement is limited to the six basic directions) that we could work on.
 Good luck on the exam, eh?
