			PLANNING EXERCISES 1 - 4
			
			
	Overall Objective:
	
		An online learning community among physicians and patients
	providing education and support for managing the many issues affecting
	women's health during the menopausal period.
	
	
	Background:

		This online site will be utilized in a pilot of the
	"Partner's In Education" (P.I.E.) program now being established by
	Susan Oliverio, M.D., M.P.H., within her primary care group practice
	at Mass. General Hospital  -- the MGH Woman's Health Associates group. 
	The Web site is a vital part of the program, providing ongoing
	education, community and support to a "preestablished" group of
	physicians and patients over an extended period of time.  Subsets of
	the community of users will be registered on the Web site at initial
	face-to-face group meetings which will introduce users (physicians
	and patients) to the P.I.E. program and to the site and provide
	preliminary education, a forum for group discussion, and diagnosis of
	individual patient symptoms/risks.
	   
		This menopause program will be the first of a number of similar
	programs addressing management of select health conditions or diseases
	which have the following common characteristics: 
	
		1)  chronic nature requiring long (or extended) term
		management, particularly where progress of the disease or
		condition may change over time; 
		
		2)  insufficient time to address patient concerns during
		typical office visit;  
		
		3)  patients would benefit from support and information
		provided by other patients with a similar condition or
		disease;
		   
		4)  physicians would benefit from a review of the current
		treatment options, studies, lay-press reports and typical
		patient concerns regarding the disease or condition;
		 
		5)  patient's need information tailored to their specific
		symptoms or risks in order to make an informed decision on
		treatment options.
		 
	Other diseases fitting this profile include:  diabetes; hyper tension;
	irritable bowel syndrome; fibromalgia; urinary incontinence; and
	chronic fatigue syndrome. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	EXERCISE 1
	
	
	*What subject will people be able to learn in the community that you
	are building?
	
		
		Management of menopause -- providing knowledge of common
		symptoms, treatment options(risks and benefits), clinical
		studies, a recommended subset of the published literature,
		and personal experiences and recommendations of a preselected
		group of physicians and other patients who have addressed or
		are currently addressing the condition of menopause.    
	
	*What do you want people to say about your service after a visit?
	
		It was a good use of my time; I learned something about or
	now have less anxiety about some aspect of menopause; I feel
	supported by other patients and/or my physician; I was able to help
	another patient or physician.
	 
	*What are the relevant distinct user classes?
	
		-  Patients
		-  Physicians
		-  Persons administering the P.I.E. program
		
	*Ideally, how will each class of user experience your service?
	
		- Patients and Physicians
		
		**Introduction to and registration at Web site:
		
		Patients will learn about the P.I.E. program, which operates
		the site, in an initial face-to-face 75-minute group patient
		meeting led by a physician facilitator at or near the
		patient's usual place of physician visits.  This meeting will
		include an assessment of the patient's prior history and
		present condition (which will subsequently be provided to both
		the patient and her physician), an introduction to the range of
		issues facing patients approaching or in menopause and some of
		the well-known treatment options, and a review of what the
		patient will experience in this group education program. This
		initial group meeting, followed shortly by an individual
		patient-physician visit, will in effect introduce each
		patient to at least a subset of the "online community"
		later provided by the Web site, and thus provide both a
		trusted portal into the community and an expectation of
		what the online community will provide.
		
		More specifically, the initial patient group meeting will
		include: 
		
			a)  review of the physiology of menopause -- an
			interactive group discussion led by the P.I.E.
			facilitator, eg, what are the known estrogen effects
			on the body (heart, bones, breasts, brain, vagina, and
			uterus) and what to expect in the peri- and
			post-menopausal periods;
			
			b)  risk of breast cancer -- all participants will
			calculate their 5-year and lifetime risk of breast
			cancer.  Assisted by the P.I.E. facilitator, each
			patient will be registered at the Web site
			(providing each patient with a login name and
			password for future site visits) and then use the Gail
			Model Risk Assessment Tool (available on the Web site)
			to enter their individual data and calculate their risk
			factor.  This model is well-validated and utilizes a
			small amount of data that can be easily entered by the
			patient. 
			 
			c)  risk of coronary heart disease -- all participants
			will calculate their lifetime risk of coronary heart
			disease using a model that predicts heart disease on
			the basis of the presence or absence of certain risk
			factors, eg, smoking, hyper tension, diabetes, age,
			hyperlipididemia.  Again each patient will enter her
			information at the Web site (alone or with assistance
			of facilitator).
			  
			d)  risk of osteoporosis -- a group discussion led
			by the faciitator based on known risk factors for this
			disease.
			 
			e)  individualized biographical and health data
			(including that related to breast cancer risk and heart
			disease risk as discussed above) will be entered
			by/for each patient at the site to establish a patient
			profile. This profile, presumably about a single page
			in length, will be provided (in electronic and/or paper
			form) to both the patient and her physician prior to
			the patient's subsequent visit with her physician.
			 
			f)  review, by the facilitator, of treatment
			approaches to menopause, eg, what hormonal
			preparations are available, what is known about
			alternative treatments and other over the counter
			preparations.
			 
			g)  discussion of psychosocial issues that arise in
			the peri- and post-menopausal periods.  Led by a
			mental health provisional (as part of the P.I.E.
			program) this section of the patient education will
			facilitate discussion and group interaction about the
			common emotional and spiritual changes that can occur
			during this time in a woman's life.
			
		Following the group meeting, and now armed with the patient
		profile, there will be an individual patient-physician visit. 
		This visit can proceed much more efficiently now that:
		the patient already knows the main issues facing
		women in menopause generally; the patient will understand
		her own profile and how it may effect treatment decisions; the
		patient may have had many of her questions answered already;
		the patient knows she will be provided future support from
		both her physician and other women in menopause by the Web
		site.  Likewise the physician will benefit from having the
		patient profile, in a compact and consistent format, 
		available at the start of the visit, as well as an
		understanding of what information the patient was presented at
		the patient group meting, and knowledge that the ongoing
		patient-physician relationship will be enhanced by the Web
		site.
		 
		Also prior to the individual visit, the physician will have
		attended a face-to-face 50 minute group session led by a
		P.I.E. facilitator -- a specialist in the area of menopause
		who will educate the physician and answer questions.  More
		specifically, this session will include:
		
			a)  review of the epidemiological literature related
			to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and menopause. 
			The information will be reviewed in a way that is
			easily understandable so that the physician can go
			back to the patient with a solid foundation of
			evidence-based knowledge about menopause and its
			treatment.
			 
			b)  review of information available through the
			lay-press, eg, what are our patients learning about
			menopause.  It will also review alternative treatments
			of menopause.
			
			c)  review of current pharmacological preparations
			(new and old) available for the treatment of
			menopause.
			
			d)  review of the P.I.E. program on menopause so that
			the physician is knowledgeable of what his/her patients
			will experience in the group patient education program
			and what is the purpose and functionality of the Web
			site.  The physicians will also be registered at and
			learn how to navigate the site at this time, again in a
			setting where assistance is readily available if
			necessary. 
			  
		In summary, both the patients and physicians will be
		introduced to and registered at the Web site by at the
		initial face-to-face group sessions.  This has many benefits,
		including security and ease of registration, ie, an
		administrator registers each user at the site and there is
		support available as the user is taught how to utilize the
		site.  By allowing only patients and physicians which are part
		of the P.I.E. program to register, and by providing an
		in-person introduction to the online community in a safe
		setting -- patients will feel welcome in the online community
		and more comfortable relying upon and sharing information
		online (knowing where the information is coming from and to
		whom it will be distributed).
		  
		However, in the future it may be determined that
		the Web site should be available to persons outside the
		P.I.E. program, in which case online registration will be
		added as a feature.  
		
		Another factor contributing to the overall likely success of
		the program is that because the initial patient group
		meetings have a diagnostic element (eg, the risk of breast
		cancer and risk of coronary heart disease assessments),
		they will be covered by standard health insurance.  This
		enhances the economic viability of the overall program.  As
		indicated above, there are clear benefits of the program to
		both patients and physicians, presenting a win-win
		opportunity for all participants.   
		
		Subsequent site visits -- by the patient
		
		**On subsequent site visits, the patient will be greeted by a
		first login page asking her to enter her login name
		and password.  Once logged-in, she will be presented with a
		second patient welcome page asking her to select among items
		in the following menu of broad categories to access:
		   
			a)  new items sent to her by her physician, which are
			tailored to her profile;
			
			b)  prior items identified by her physician as
			pertinent to patients' having her type of profile;
			
			c)  messages from other patients addressed to her
			(including ability to initiate or reply to messages);
			
			d)  discussion forum, including ability to ask a
			question of the community and receive an answer,
			as well as review of commonly-asked question/answer
			pairs; 
			
			e)  chat forum;
			
			f)  searching of the pre-screened publication content
			of the site;
			
			g)  sending an email message to her physician;
			
			h)  review of her confidential patient profile, which
			may now include instructions for all treatments
			prescribed by her physician.
			 
		The welcome page may also include relevant pop-up notices, eg,
		that she needs to schedule a follow-up visit with her
		physician, or refill a prescription.  For patients needing
		extra support or monitoring, a notice may ask whether there
		has been any change in her condition since her last
		physician visit, in which case she should notify her physician
		ASAP, or a reminder to take certain medications at the
		instructed times.
		
		Subsequent site visits -- by the physician
		
		**On subsequent site visits by physicians, the same login
		page(as for patients) will appear first, asking for their
		login and password. As indicated above, the physician will be
		providing tailored information to his patients, presumably to
		groups of patients having similar conditions, via the Web
		site, and may also receive non-urgent email messages from
		his/her patients to which he/she needs to reply.  The
		physician will want to access site-available educational
		materials on menopause, his patients' profile records, and
		monitor his patients' experience at the site by for example
		reviewing the posted question-and-answer exchanges.  In
		addition, he/she may wish to answer posted questions,
		providing a forum for teaching the community in general and
		assuring his/her patients that he believes in the value of the
		site.
		  
		Once logged in, the physician will be presented with a
		second physician welcome page with options to access:
		
			a) new educational items entered since last visit to
			the site;
			
			b) messages from other physicians addressed to
			him/her(including ability to initiate or reply to
			messages);
			
			c) discussion forum, including review of
			communications involving his/her own patients;
			also, ability to ask a question of the community and
			receive an answer, as well as review of commonly-asked
			question/answer pairs;
			 
			d) searching of pre-screened publications content of
			the site;
			
			e) adding a publication or physician-authored article
			to the publications content of the site;
			 
			f) creating and sending items to all or a subset of
			patients; 
			
			g) review of any confidential patient profile;
			
		Site visits -- by administrators 
		
		**A site-wide administrator should log in and see a page that
		provides fields with statistics on various events at the site,
		such as number of new users (over a given time period),
		activity in the discussion forum, questions addressed to the
		administrator by a user, and new items added to the
		question/answer forum or publications content of the site which
		may require editing by the administrator.
		
		A physician may have administrative privileges as well in
		order to monitor and assess the usefulness of the site to
		his/her patients.
		
		A physician of administrator may also be able to schedule a
		face-to-face meeting of a subset of users.
		
		
		
		
	*What should a user on a mobile phone be able to do?  Is it
	productive to mix voice and WAP interaction?
	
		In future implementations, it may be worthwhile to allow
	users to access the site via mobile phone, with either WAP and/or
	voice interaction.  Most useful actions may include providing access to
	email a physician, or pop up notices with reminders regarding
	physician visits or medication instructions.
	
	
	
	
	EXERCISE 2
	
	
		Books, such as:
		
		-  A Seven-Step Program for Getting Through Menopause and
		Enjoying a Longer Healthier Life Without Drugs, by Catherine
		Lowes;
		
		-  Today and Tomorrow's Women, Menopause:  Before and After,
		by Virginia Layng Millonig;
		
		-  A Change For the Better:  A Woman's Guide Through
		Menopause, by Patricia Davies;
		
	are a good source of general information on menopause, but are time
	consuming to read, relatively expensive to purchase, and limited to
	the viewpoint of one author or group of authors.  Often one has to
	read many such books before discovering the possible bias, limited
	knowledge or untrustworthiness of a select author.  
	
		Magazines, such as:
		
		-  Prevention;
		
		-  Journal of New England Medicine;
		
	are typically written for either a general audience of patients, or may
	be too technical for a lay reader to understand.  Again, finding a good
	magazine article is a time-consuming and expensive (yearly
	subscription cost) effort.
	
		Informal conversations with neighbors or friends is a
	haphazard affair, unlikely to produce a person with the same profile
	or interests at any given point in time, assuming that other person
	even has any accurate or complete knowledge of the subject.
	
		In contrast, the proposed Web site is a community of
	physicians and  patients, all addressing the issues of menopause at the
	same time, and consisting of a large enough number of patients
	that finding a match in patient profile -- leading to peer support
	and ability to share a relevant experiences -- is likely.  The
	physicians provide an authoritative and trusted source of information;
	they know their patient's profile and can tailor the information
	provided to that profile.  There is an overall sense that because the
	site is run by an entity whose purpose is providing medical care, that
	the contents of the site can be relied upon.
	
	
	
	EXERCISE 3
	
		The following is an evaluation of the best online community on
	menopause found to date, including an accessment of how well it meets
	the six designated elements of sustainability:
	
		1)  magnet content authored by experts
		
		2)  means of collaboration
		
		3)  powerful facilities for browsing and searching both magnet
		content and contributed content
		
		4)  means of delegation of moderation
		
		5)  means of identifying members who are imposing an undue
		burden on the community and ways of changing their behavior
		and/or excluding them from the community without them
		realizing it
		
		6)  means of software extension by community members
		themselves
