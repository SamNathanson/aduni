Menopause Group -- answers to PS on WAP
# PS "Adding Wireless Users to your Community

#---------------------------------------------------------------
Ex 1.   Times                  PYWEB emulator   ---  HTML browser
a. Weather www.boston.com/        12"                     3"              

b. Stock quote for IBM          4:00 and fail		 30" 
 (on www.boston.com, I could search in the emulator for a quick quote for IBM
 and was able to see the labels but not the data for current price.)

c. ineluctable                   :40                     12"
 (dictionary.com
d. amazon.com                   2:30 and fail            35"
 (With the WAPalizer, it was too painful to get the book "Imaginary Gardens"
that I could find in seconds in the HTML browser.

e. photo.net                    1:50 and unsure        1:22
 (on photo.net with the emulator, I could not tell if I was seeing the
 latest question or the latest unanswered question.  With HTML, I could look at the time stamps in just a few moments.)

Ex 2. How our community can use WAP.  
In our medical community, users belong to groups, and many of these
groups have meeting time, place, and note -- e.g. Mon 7pm, MGH 2-135, Please
bring you questionnaire!   Aftert a user logs in, his/her special
information is visible near the bottom of his/her home page.  We must
determine that a user is on a WAP connection, then let them login, then
deliver their pertinent meeting information.

If we want to, we could add the ability to tell an administrator about current
load and recent usage.

Ex 3.

Step 1:  Had to edit configuration file todd.tcl and restart nsd.
The online AOLSERVER documentation (which shows as a blkank page to Netscape,
but visible to IE) implied (to Rusty; thanks, Rusty), that I needed a section header:

ns_section ns/mimetypes
ns_param .wml text/vnd.wap.wml

Step 2.  TELNET session did indeed differ slightly from the handout's printed header:
[tsjoblom@localhost tsjoblom]$ telnet 10.11.0.111 8080
Trying 10.11.0.111...
Connected to 10.11.0.111.

  <p>We're not in the 1970s anymore.</p>
 </card>
</wml>Connection closed by foreign host.  

Step 3.  Find a WAP emulator.  
I tried GELON and had such a bad experience, even on a WIndows box with cable modem, that
I gave up.  There were too many advertisements!  With Jeffrey's help, I downloaded:
/www.pyweb.com/php/license.php3?url=/deck-it/deckit-1.2.4.tar.gz&lg=fr...
and installed.  I loaded the page and saw the quote about the seventies.  
I also looked at my old PS1 website, and searched all quotations for "todd".  If I'm patient
enough to scroll, I can see them all.

Step 4.  No luck here; no-one can afford it.  I did read on Google about how you would
use a phone to do a Google search; they said to GoTo wap.google.com.  Unfortuantely, since
I don't have a phone, I tried this with the emulator and got 
"Malformed http response <HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Bad Request </TITLE></HEAD>"
It seems that Google did not really make their site WAP-enables, or maybe it's just my emulator
which is bad.

Ex. 4 

file: login.wml for input of emial and pwd

<wml> 		
	<card id="login" title="PIE"> 
            <do type="accept" label="Next">
              <go method="post" href="http://10.11.0.111:8080/login-wap.tcl">

            </p> 
           </card> 
</wml>

file: login-wap.tcl that display email and pwd with only first character

set email [ns_queryget wml_email]
set pwd [ns_queryget wml_pwd]

set display_pwd [string index $pwd 0]

for { set i 1 } { $i < [string length $pwd] } { incr i } {
   append display_pwd "*"
} 

set page_content "
<wml>
  <card>
    <p>Email: $email<br/>
       Pwd: $display_pwd</p>
 </card>
</wml>

ns_return 200 text/vnd.wap.wml $page_content
