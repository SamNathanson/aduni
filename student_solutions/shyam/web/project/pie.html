<font size=+2 color=blue>Do you need help in understanding the common symptoms and latest therapies on menopause?</font>

<blockquote>
If you are a woman approaching or undergoing menopause, generally 40 years of age or greater, and are concerned about:

<ul>
<li> what can I anticipate (common symptoms)<p>
<li> how can I maximize my likelihood of a healthy transition into menopause<p>
<li> what are my risks for heart disease and breast cancer during this time<p>
<li> what therapies are recommended to manage the symptoms and control the risks<p>
</ul>
<p>

then this program is for you.  By forming patient and support groups, 
through initial face-to-face meetings and an online community, you will come to understand and
maximize your sense of well-being and likelihood of a smooth transition.

<font size=+2 color=blue>How will my physician be involved?</font>

<blockquote>
You and your physician will be enrolled in the Partners In
                Education (PIE) program on menopause.  PIE is a non-profit
                organization of educators dedicated to improving patient and
                physician understanding of the common symptoms, increased
                risks of disease (eg, heart and breast cancer), and range of
                therapies for managing menopause.
<p>
There are 3 parts to the program:
<p>
<ol>
<li> You (the patient) will first attend a 50-minute group
                meeting with similar patients (from your physician's
                practice) in which:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A PIE physician/leader, a specialist in the area of
                        menopause, will present a program introduction and
                        overview of symptoms and therapies of menopause<p>
<li>You will receive an initial assessment of your
                        individual risks of heart disease and breast cancer<p>
<li>You will participate in a group discussion with
                        your community of patients and physician/leader, to
                        hear about common concerns and answer your questions<p>
</ul>
<p>

<li> You will have an individual office visit with your
                physician, in which the foundation for a meaningful two-way
                discussion has been established based on your prior group
                meeting and initial risk assessments, and based on your
                physician having similarly undergone a review of the program
                and latest studies/therapies on menopause.
<p>
<li>You will receive ongoing support, via the online community, in which you have immediate access to:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Messages from your physician tailored to your symptoms<p>
<li> A question and answer (Q&A) forum<p>
<li> Selected publications recommended by your physician<p>
</ul>
<p>
</ol>

<blockquote>

                A primary care physician, otherwise facing insufficient time
                to review the latest studies/therapies on menopause, and
                insufficient time to meet with, discuss and track his/her
                patients, will be provided with:<p>
                
                        <ul>
			<li>A better informed patient and preliminary
                        diagnostic assessments at the initial patient office
                        visit, greatly enhancing the quality of the visit and
                        resulting satisfaction of both the patient and
                        physician
                        <p>
                        <li>Immediate access to the latest studies and
                        treatments on menopause, including a discussion forum
                        among peer physicians
                        <p>
                        <li>A quick and easy-to-use way to communicate to groups
                        of his/her patients recommended publications,
                        treatment schedules, advice on symptoms and side
                        effects to watch for, office visit reminders, etc.
