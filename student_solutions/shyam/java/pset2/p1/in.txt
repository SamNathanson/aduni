Congolese Venture Into Streets

By ARNAUD ZAJTMAN, Associated Press Writer

KINSHASA, Congo (AP) - Residents of this central African capital
returned to the streets Thursday for the first time since reports
began circulating that the president was gunned down at his palace.

Security forces kept a low profile. Traders arrived from nearby
villages with their goods, but many city markets stayed closed as
their administrators didn't turn up. Most stores were shuttered,
banks were closed and the main business district nearly deserted.

At the downtown Cybermatonge cafe, however, a crush of people
was anxiously trying to get the latest news off the internet.

``I don't understand anything about our situation,'' said
Matthieu Kassindi, a civil servant who was trying to reach his
sister abroad for information.

State-run radio was still broadcasting a Wednesday government
statement insisting President Laurent Kabila was wounded but alive,
despite reports from numerous foreign officials that he had died of
his injuries in 30 minutes of intense gunfire Tuesday.

Cabinet officials thrust Kabila's son into power Wednesday,
naming him temporary head of government to fill the power vacuum
that has threatened to throw this vast, deeply troubled nation into
even more turmoil. The younger Kabila, who already headed the armed
forces, has made no public statements.
