Shai-

1. Any subset of  n  elements where order is important

   is either the empty set or a first element (one of
   n  elements) followed by a subset of  (n-1)
    elements where order is important.  Hence the
     recursion formula.

2. A closed form for this recurrence is
       T(n) = [e(n!)]
   where  [x]  means the greatest integer less than or
    equal to  x.

   (I couldn't find the greatest integer symbol on my
    computer.)
