   This is a note from my Bridge partner, who is a Poker expert, a software
   engineer and a pretty darn good mathematician :-)

But who gets a little careless sometimes...

      Approximately -- what are the real odds to get a pair and no better in 5
      card poker hand

   Exactly a pair is 13 * 6 * C(12,4)/ C(52,5). I proved this in class last
   week. I think it ended up being 42%

Oops! That should have been 13 * 6 * C(12,4) * 4^4 / C(52,5)

      How about a pair or better?

   The odds are just a hair under 50%. The median 5-card hand is something
   like AKQJ4.

Exact chance of a no-pair hand is

  ((C(13,5) * 5^4) - (4 * C(13,5)) - (10 * 5^4) + 40)/C(52,5),

which should  be a tiny bit above .5
