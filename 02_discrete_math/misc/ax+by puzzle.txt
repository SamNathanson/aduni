   Since my gut instinct here is to say "Are you sure?"  I dont call it
   trivial... :-)

Below (a-1)(b-1) not all n are expressible.  Above ab, at least one n is
expressible in more than 1 way, so the question is whether any n between
(a-1)(b-1) is expressible in 2 ways.

Let n = ax'+by' = ax+by be such an n < ab.  Without loss of generality
let x'<x and y < y'.  So b(y'-y) = a(x-x') ... both sides are positive and
less than n. gcd(a,b) = 1, so a|(y'-y) but then l.h.s. is a multiple of ab,
which is inconsistent with < n < ab.  So no n < ab can be expressed as
ax+by in more than one way.

        I also don;t see that this obvious...

   Knowing you, they are both likely true.... :-)

Well, I was just guessing.

Clearly, for n >= ab+(a-1)(b-1) you can express it in at least 2 ways.
Consider n' = n-ab.  If n' = ax+by, then n = a(x+b)+by AND n = ax +(b+a)y.

So the only question is whether n = ab+(a-1)(b-1) - 1 can be expressed in 2
or more ways. First, note that there is no pair x and y, positive integers,
s.t. (a-1)(b-1)-1 = ax+by.

Let n = ab+(a-1)(b-1) - 1 = ax'+by' = ax+by.  x' and x must both be > b,
else (x-b),y is a pair that expresses (a-1)(b-1)-1.  y' and y must both be
> a, else x,(y-a) is a pair that expresses (a-1)(b-1)-1.  If all 4 x,x',y,
and y' are that big, though, then n has to be greater than 2ab, but ab +
(a-1)(b-1)-1 < 2ab.
