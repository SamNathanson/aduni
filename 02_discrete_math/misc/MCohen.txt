My previous analysis was flawed (making, incidentally, your agreement
with it also wrong).  The resolution of repeated questions (to determine
a lie) is 2^(n/2) (and not 2^(n-1)).  This is still, as you observe,
still too loose.

Anyway, i now realize (embarrassed that i didn't notice earlier)
that the riddle yeilds easily to an information theoretic
approach.  Namely, Hamming codes, a class of single-error-correcting
codes.  (Your former colleague Vera Pless would be all over this.)

For example, Hamming(7,4) codes encode 4 bits of non-redundant information
into a 7-bit field, the excess 3 parity bits used to detect and correct
single errors (which might be noise on a communication channel, toggles
in memory/storage, or a "lie") across the entire (7-bit) encoding.

"check bits" (c)        "questions" (2^c - 1)   "data" (2^c - 1 - c)    "numbers" (2^(2^c - 1 - d))
----------------        ---------------------   --------------------    ---------------------------

4                       15                      11                      2^11
5                       31                      26                      2^26
6                       63                      57                      2^57

So the answer to the riddle (number resolvable by binary sequence with single error) is
something like:

                   floor(lg2(|questions|+1))
  [|questions| - 2^                         ]
2^
