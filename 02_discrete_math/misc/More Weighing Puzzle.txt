2 balance puzzles, you get to weigh things on a balance against
either other (ie each weighing gives you <, =, or > ).

1) 8 balls, 7 identical in weight, 1 slightly different. In 3 weighings
find the odd ball and whether it is lighter or heavier. There are at
least 2 solutions, neither of which I remember off hand.

2) 6 balls, 2 red, 2 white, 2 blue. One of each color is Heavy,
one of each is Light. Heavies all weigh the same as do Lights.
In 2 weighings, label the balls. (3 is of course triv).
