I have never heard of Hamming Codes, but the approach
appears to be correct.

The first four questions are:

"Is the first binary digit a 0?"

"Is the second binary digit a 0?"

"Is the third binary digit a 0?"

"Is the fourth binary digit a 0?"

We are left with five possible integers, the integer
we get if all of the answers are truthful and the four
integers we get if the first, the second, the third or
the fourth answer, respectively, is a lie.

Assume that player "B" has lied once to the first four
questions.  Then he must answer the remaining
questions truthfully.  Use the next two questions to
reduce the four possibilities to one, and use the last
question to
confirm the remaining possibility.

If the last answer confirms, then that is the number.
If it contradicts, then the assumption that "B" lied
once during the first four questions is false, and the
fifth possibility - the one that assumes that "B"
answered the first four questions truthfully - is the
number chosen.

To get an upper bound on the span for n questions,
note  that there are 2^n possible strings of yes-no
answers to your n questions, and that any number
chosen gives rise to (n+1) strings, the string
corresponding to the truthful sequence and the n
strings corresponding to a lie to any one of the n
questions.

No two strings of yes-no answers can be the same,
otherwise "A" cannot uniquely determine "B's" integer.

So an upper bound for Span(n) is (2^n)/(n+1).

In the case n=7 we have Span(7) = or < 16.

Since we have shown above that Span(7) = or > 16, we
have Span(7) = 16.

It can easily be shown that, if n = 2^k - 1, then
Span(n) = 2^(n-k).

Now on to the harder question:  what is Span(n) for
general n ?

Can you give me references for Hamming Codes?
