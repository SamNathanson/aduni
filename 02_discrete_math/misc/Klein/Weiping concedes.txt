Hi Mr. Klein,

Yes your general result is true.
But I suspect finding span(n), which I assume
is the set of possible integers one can choose
so the problem can be solved in n queries,
for general n is #P1-complete.  It is similar
to the problem of finding S(n), the minimum
number of comparisons to sort n numbers.

Best regards,
