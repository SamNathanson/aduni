I guess your student thinks an error correction
code (e.g., Hamming code, so for n=16, it's 4+3)
is enough.  But that's non-adaptive queries,
The same set of membership
questions are asked without considering the answers.
That's probably optimal for non-adpative queries.

Here is what I have in mind.  Needs more thought:

At each step i, we keep sets S0, S1,..., Si,
where if he lies at the ith answer, then
Si contains the solution.
S0 is for all truth so far.

So the first query asks "is x in {1,...,8}?"
and if the answer is yes (no is symmetric),
then S0={1,...,8} and S1={9,...,16}.

At the (i+1)th step, we ask
"if you never lied and x in S0/2, or
if you lied at 1st answer and x in S1/2, or ..."
If he never lied before, and he does not lie now,
then we'll have S0=S0/2.
If he lies this time, we will have Si+1=(S0 - S0/2).
If he lied before then he can't lie again, so
all the remaining Sj = Sj/2.
Combine all the cases, we have
S0=S0/2, S1=S1/2, ..., Si+1=(S-S0/2).

Example (assume all yes answer. no is symmetric)
S0={1,...,8}, S1={9,...,16} ->
S0={1,...,4}, S1={9,...,12}, S2={5,...,8} ->
S0={1,2}, S1={9,10}, S2={5,6}, S3={3,4} ->
S0={1}, S1={9}, S2={5}, S3={3}, S4={2}

Now a recursive version of the problem.
Q(n) = logn + Q(logn).
So I guess there is nothing gained using
adaptive here.
