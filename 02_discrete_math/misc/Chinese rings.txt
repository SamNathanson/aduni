The basic idea is that

T(n) = T(n-1) + 2T(n-2) + 1

This is because we first recursively remove the leftmost  ring, which is
done by a sequence
of removing n-2 rings, a single move, and putting n-2 rings back on.

Then we repeat recursively to remove the next n-1 rings.

Once you have this recurrence relationship, you can make a chart bottom
up ...

T(1) = 1     T(2) = 2    T(3)= 5    T(4)= 10    T(6) = 21    T(7) = 42
etc

From this chart, most people can guess the recurrence:

T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1, n odd            2T(n-1), n even.

This is NOT easy to derive directly from the original recurrence by
substitution but can be proved pretty easily by induction on n.

    (it makes  a great example of the power of guessing and proof by
induction)

These equations then imply a single substitutuion, that T(n) = 4T(n-2) +
2 , n even     4T(n-2) + 1, n odd

and these two equations can be solved easily by repeated substituion
(the most intituive method for recurrence solutions)

to give a closed form T(n) = 2/3 (2^n -1), n even        1/3 (2^(n+1)
-1)  n odd.

Does that help?
