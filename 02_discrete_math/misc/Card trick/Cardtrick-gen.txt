I guess you can use a technique like this to compress an image but JPEG does
a much better job.  It also takes into account that small distortions of the
image will not alter its appearance.

What is interesting here is that all the standard compression algorithms
assume that the data needs to be reconstructed in order.  Is there ever a
case when order doesn't matter? I still haven't thought of one.

    Sometimes you think more like a mathematician than an engineer.

    These are both good natural generalizations opening up lots of new
questions.

    You mean the idea of "compressing" unordered chunks of M items into
ordered
chunks of N items, where N<M?

    I thought about this on the train to work today.   There was a mural on
the
wall of South Station made out of tiny little blurs, which close up look like
nothing and farther away look like a clear picture.  It seemed to me that if
you
wanted to transfer this picture over a wire, you could break it up into small
enough chunks so that the order of the blurs wouldnt matter within that chunk
--
that is you could reconstruct them in any order and not ruin the big picture
in a
noticable way.  Then we could use this scheme to send chunks of 5 by an
ordered
set of 4... a 20% compression and we pay virtually nothing....  some "blur"
perhaps that no one will notice...

    What do you think of this?
