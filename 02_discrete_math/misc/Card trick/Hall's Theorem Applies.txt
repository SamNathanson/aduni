So I guess you meant this today -- but I did not parse the
implications...

If the bipartite graph on two sets of C(n!+n-1, n) nodes, is regular
where each node has degree n!, then clearly it satisfies Hall's
theorem's condition.

(In fact, any regular bipartite graph must satisfy the conditions for
Hall's theorem; namely that any subset of k nodes has edges to at least
k other nodes)

Proof:
Take any subset size k of the nodes on either side of the graph, the
number of edges coming out of these nodes is exactly kn!.  If the number
of nodes incident to these edges on the other side of the graph is less
than k, then by the extended Pigeonhole principle one of the nodes on
the other side of the graph must have strictly more than kn!/k = n!
edges incident to it, but we know that every node in the graph has
exactly degree n!, hence this is a contradiction and it is therefore
impossible for a subset of nodes of size k to connect to fewer than k
nodes on the other side.

Hence, by Hall's theorem there is a perfect matching -- as we all now
know.
