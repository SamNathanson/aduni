Hi Shai:

Does a better strategy for the card trick be rememberable by a human?
Or will it be a list of computer-geenrated numbers that the magician can look
up?

I get a coding for choosin 3 cards with a deck of 8 cards. See the enclosed
file.
Also generated an apparently unique coding for choosing 4 cards from a deck
of 20 cards. Its a huge list and i am looking over it to see if  there are
really
no duplicates.

Shyam
