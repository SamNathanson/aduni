This explains more or less how to do the trick.  Do you want to try to
show them the 3cards out of 8 version of this tomorrow in recitation?
(Some people asked to see how it works...)

I'd prefer to make the problem slightly more challenging by increasing the
size of the deck to 64 cards, and also having someone else in the audience
flip a coin.  The magician now needs to announce BOTH the unannounced card
and the result of the coin flip.

OR, just take a single deck of 124 cards, numbered 0 to 124, but no coin
flip.

In all cases, the cards are numbered 0 to n-1.

SOLUTION:

The magician adds the value of the 5 cards, modulo 5, giving a remainder
of r. He then hides the (r+1)st card in rank order among the 5.  That's
the one the magician must pick.

Once the other four cards are known, there will "a priori" be (n-4)/5
possible values for the missing card.  These possibilities occur every
fifth one if the four known numbers were deleted from the deck.  For
example, suppose the 4 known numbers are 17, 19, 23, and 29, whose sum is
3 mod 5.  Hence, if the missing number is in the 0th interval (below 17),
it must be 2 mod 5; if it is in the first interval it would have to be 3
mod 5; in the next interval, 4 mod 5; in the next interval, 0 mod 5; and
above 29, 1 mod 5:

0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901...?
  ?    ?    ?    X?X   X ?   X ?    ?    ?    ?    ?
  0    1    2     3      4     5    6    7    8    9...

If n = 124, there are exactly 24 question marks in this sequence; if n <=
64, there are <=12.  The 24 permuations of 4 objects (best labelled
0,1,2,3) are lexicographically ordered to correspond to the integers from
0 through 23, or from 0 through 11 in the less significant field and 0 or
1 (= H or T, again alphabetical, lexicographic order) in the more
significant field.

So, if the four known cards are revealed in the order 23, 17, 29, 19, then
the magician converts to the permutation 2130.  Mod 24, this is the
permutation number 16, (numbered from 0 upwards) = 12 + 4, so the coin is
tails and the card is the one numbered 25.

The conversion between permutations and their numbers isn't hard. In
general, multiply the rank of the first number by 6 = 3!, then the
residual rank of the next number by 2 = 2!, and finally, the residual rank
of the next-to-last number by 1.  In the present case, 2x6 + 1x3 + 1x1 =
16 = 1x 12 + 4, when converted to the two fields.
