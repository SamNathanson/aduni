Ordered subsets of a set with n elements ---

Dear Shai,
 That's great that you could spend so much time on ralbag!
Concerning the Shai sequence, I don't recall ever seeing
it as such. Of course, the derangement satisfy
D_n=n*D_{n-1}\pm 1 so it is probably signed dernagement.
Remmel has a combinatorial proof that is not totally obvious,
so perhaps it can be extended to the Shai sequence.
Of course Shalosh can obtain the recurrence from the sum automatically.
Best wishes
Doron

The query I sent him is below...

Hello Doron --

I am teaching discrete math this semester and I was working on the
following problem which I am sure is part of a standard treatment -- but

I cannot find any mention of this in my usual looking places...

Would you mind enlightening me?

To count the number of ways to choose a subset of n elements when we DO
care about the order seems to be the sum of

C(n,0) + C(n,1) + 2!C(n,2) + 3!C(n,3) + ... + n!C(n,n)

This gives a recurrence equation T_n = n*T_(n-1) + 1.

Questions:

1.  Is there a simple combinatorial explanation for this recurrence?
2.  Is there a closed form for this recurrence?
3.  It seems like there might be some similarity between this sum and
the number of derangements.  Is there?

Thanks for your expertise.
