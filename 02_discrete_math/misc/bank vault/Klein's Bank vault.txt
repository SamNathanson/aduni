A complete answer:

If the time of transmission of a message from one man
to the next is less than K (but equal to or greater
than K-1) blinks, and the players cannot count as high
as 2K, then I cannot even synchronize two players.

If the players can count as high as 2K, then all is
well.

In the given case, you said that the players could
count as high as two, so a solution to the problem
exists if the time of transmission of a message is
less than one blink of the light.

Now proceed as follows:

In round 1, each player determines whether he is a
middleman (M-A), a semi-middleman (S-A) or neither.
Now remove the middlemen and the semi-middlemen from
the line.  We are left with two sub-lines of neithers.

In round 2, we determine the middlemen and the
semi-middlemen of these two sub-lines (the M-B's nd
the S-B's).  We remove these middlemen and
semi-middlemen from the original line and are left
with four sub-lines of neithers.

We proceed in this fashion until all participants are
labeled either M-X or S-X.  (Since there at least
2^(k-1) new middlemen in the k-th round, the number o
middlemen all told will eventually equal n, the
(finite) number of players in the game.)

Each player now knows his designation and knows how
many rounds there are in the game.  In particular, the
M(last)'s know they are the last middlemen.

The left-most player now sends a message "A" to the
player on his right. Every player who recieves the
message, other than an M-A or an S-A, transmits he
message on the next blink of the light to the player
on his far side.

If an M-A player receives the message, he sends a "B"
message to his two neighbors on the next blink of the
light. If an S-A player receives the message, he first
coordinates with his S-A twin.  On the next blink of
the light, he tells the other S-A player to send a "B"
message on the following blink of the light to the
player on his far side.  He himself sends a "B"
message the other way on the same light-blink (the
second blink after he received his "A" message).  (He
can count to two.)  The two S-A players are thus
synchronized.

In like manner, the "B" message is transmitted by
every player except the M-B and the S-B players.  Upon
receiving a "B" message, an M-B player sends a "C"
message to his two immediate neighbors;  an S-B player
takes a moment to coordinate with his S-B twin and
both then send "C" messages simultaneously to their
non-twin neighbors.

Eventually, the N middlemen receive "N" messages.  If
a player is an S-N, he tells his immediate neighbors
(on the next blink) that they are to turn their keys
in their locks on the blink following their reception
of the message.  He himself turns his key in his lock
on the blink following his sending of that message.

If he is an S-N, he first coordinates with his twin on
the next blink.  Both S-N's then send the key-turning
message simultaneously to their non-twin neighbors on
the following blink.  (Again, the first S-N can count
to two.)  And everybody turns his key in his lock on
the blink after that.

If the vault doesn't explode, it will open.

Graphically, this can be pictured in real time as a
rectangle in the first quadrant in the Cartesian plane
with one vertex at the origin.  The x-axis represents
the line of players, the y-axis is the time line.

Initially, the rectangle has a single vertical
midline.

A ray projects from the origin at an initial angle.
When it hits the miline, it breaks in two.  One half
follows the original path, the other reflects in the
midline.  Simultaneously, two vertical quarter-lines
appear.

When these new rays hit the quarter-lines, each splits
in two, ray and reflection. Simultaneously, four
vertical eighth-lines appear.

Eventually, there will be 2^n rays arriving at an
equal spacing at the same time.  And here the graphic
demonstration ends.

For people who think in binary numbers, the above
rectangle can be scaled so that the base extends from
0 to 1. Let the points in h base be given by their
binary expansions (i.e., 5/32 = 0.00101).

A ray projects from the origin at an initial angle.
When the first digit after the decimal point changes,
the ray splits (ray and reflection). The
second-generation rays split again after the second
digit after the decimal point changes.  The third
generation rays split again when the third digit after
the decimal point changes.  And so on.

(I sippose the decimal point should be called a binary
point.)

It takes a bit of talking (and smoothing out) to see
how this evolving picture represents the original
problem.  Indeed, it takes a bit of talking to justify
some of the above statements.  If you want to talk any
of this out with me, give me a ring.  (802-865-5039)
