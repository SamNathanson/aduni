This is very clever.

But I had a section of his idea I did not understand.  Please forward this to him.

    Up to here - seems very well done.

    It seems that there are MANY messages being sent upstream and downstream
simultaneously.
I agree that the middle person(s) will receive word on both sides and they will know they
are middle people.

But during that proces, and AFTER that,  there are still stray messages running around,
which might incorrectly inform other people that they are middles when in fact they are
not yet middles.  Can you convince me that this will never happen?  Can you "kill" the old
messages?  Do you need to?

A less elegant but more clearly correct idea, is for the person with value 1, to send one
message out at the rate of one flash per pass in the downstream direction, and another at
the rate of 3 flashes per pass.   These two messages will be passed on by zeros, and
reflected back by ones.  They will cross at the "middle" person.  When a person finds out
that they are middle, they "kill" the messages by not passing them on.  This allows a more
controlled approach for the message passing.
