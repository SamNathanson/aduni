Discrete Math Problem Set 7

1a) 	101 99
	99   2		101 = 1*99+2  -->  2 = 101 - 1*99
	2     1		99 = 49*2+1 ---> 1 = 99 - 49*2

gcd(99,101) = 1 = 99 - 49*2 = 99 - 49 *(101-1*99) = 99 - 49*101 + 49 *99 = 
50*99-49*101
which is also equivalent to 50*101-51*99
(x=50, y=49, u=50, v=51)

1b)

35 	10
10	5	35 = 3*10+5 --> 5 = 35 - 3*10
5	0
gcd(10,35) = 5 = 1*35-3*10
which is also equivalent to 32*10-9*35
(u=1, w=3, x=32, y=9)

1c)

12	7
7	5	12=1*7+5  --> 5 = 12 - 1*7
5	2	7=1*5+2 --> 2 =7-1*5
2	1	5=2*2+1 --> 1 = 5 -2*2
gcd(7,12) = 1=5 - 2*2 = 5 - 2*(7-1*5) = 3*5 -2*7 = 3*(12-1*7)-2*7=3*12-5*7
which is also equivalent to 7*7-4*12
(u=3,v=5,x=7,y=4)

1d)

42	36
36	6	42=1*36+6 --> 42-1*36
6	0
gcd(36,42) = 6 = 42-1*36
which is also equivalent to 41*36-35*42
(u=1,v=1,x=41,y=35)

3a)

(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4)^3
= (1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 10x^3 + 15x^4 + ...)
since the coefficients are those of the 3rd diagonal of Pascal's triangle:


                          1
                         1 1
                        1 2 1
                       1 3 3 1
                     1 4  6  4  1
                   1 5 10 10 5 1
                  1 6 15 20 15 6 1

x^4 has coefficient 15.

3b)

(1+x^2+x^4)^2 * (1+x+x^2)^2
= (1+2x^2+3x^4+2x^6+x^8) * (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)
Coefficient of x^4: 1+2*3+3 = 10

3c)

>From a): (1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+...) = (1+3x+6x^2+10x^3+15x^4+...)
x^4 has coefficient 15


4)

We have to find the number of solutions to:
e(h) + e(e) + e(l) + e(p) = 5
where e(l) <=1, e(p) <=1, e(h) <=5, e(e) <=5
The generating function is:
(1+x)(1+x)(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5)(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5)
and the answer is the coefficient in fornt of x^5 which is 20.

5)

1/(1-10x+21x^2) = 1/((1-7x)(1-3x)) = A/(1-7x) + B/(1-3x)
Solving for A and B:
A - 3Ax + B - 7Bx = 1
implies
A+B = 1 and 3A=-7B
implies
A=7/4 and B= -3/4

Therefore:

A/(1-7x) + B/(1-3x) = (7/4)/(1-7x) - (3/4)/(1-3x)

Coefficient of x^n = (7/4) * 7^n - (3/4) * 3^n = 7^(n+1)/4 - 3^(n+1)/4

6a)

The distinct divisors for p^a are p^0(=1), p, p^2, p^3, ..., p^a.
Therfore, number of divisors = a+1.

6b)

m =  p1^a1*p2^a2*...pn^an where p1, p2, ... are distinct primes.
Then we have a1 + 1 choices for p1, a2 + 1 choices for p2, ....
Therefore, number of distinct divisors = (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)...(an + 1).

7)

Is the coefficient of x^k in the following expression:
(1+x+x^2+x^3+...)(1+x^5+x^10+x^15+...)(1+x^10+x^20+x^30+...)(1+x^25+x^50+x^75+...)

8a)

(x+x^2+x^3+...+x^10)(1+x^5+x^10+...)(1+x^10+x^20+...)(1+x^25+x^50+...)
Coefficient in front of x^100 = 79.
(got this by using scheme polynomial package from SICP PS-6)

8b)

(x+x^2+x^3+...)(x^5+x^10+...)(x+10+x^20+...)(x^25+x^50+....)
Coefficient of x^100 = 21
(got this by using scheme polynomial package from SICP PS-6)

11a) R is not an equivalence relation since it is not transitive.

11b) RoR means that we have ordered pairs {a,b} where a and b have a common 
co-author.

11c) Let R* be the set of ordered pairs {a,b} where a is connected to b via 
any number of co-authors.
R* is reflexsive since {a,a} belongs to R* for every author a.
R* is symmetric since {a,b} belongs to R* implies {b,a} belongs to R* 
because if we can trace a path of co-authors from a to b, we can re-trace 
the path from b to a.
R* is transitive since if both {a,b} and {b,c} belongs to R* then {a,c} 
belongs to R* because if we can trace a path from a to b and b to c, we can 
also trace a path from a to c.
