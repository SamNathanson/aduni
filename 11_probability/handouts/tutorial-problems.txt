Tutorial 1 Applied Probability some problems sourced from textbook.

1> Prove the following relations using the axioms of the algebra of events. 

	A	If Phi is the null set, Phi'=U
	B	A + B = A + A'B + ABC

2> A four-sided die labeled {1,2,3,4} is roled 2 times.
   Create a simple notation denoting the events:
   	A	The first roll is a 3.
   	B 	The second roll is a 4.
        C	The first roll is a 3 and the second roll is a 4.

3> P(A) = .4  P(B') = .7  P(A+B) = .7
   determine 
   	A	P(B)
	B	P(AB)
	C	P(A'|B')
