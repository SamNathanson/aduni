<b>Directory Commands</b><p>

<tt>ls [directory]</tt><br>
Lists all the files in the specified directory. If no directory is specified, it defaults to the current directory.<p>

<tt>cd [directory]</tt><br>
Changes the current directory to the specified directory. If no directory is specified, it brings you to your home directory.<p>

<tt>mkdir [directory]</tt><br>
Creates a new directory.<p>

<tt>rmdir [directory]</tt><br>
Removes the specified (empty) directory. To remove a non-empty directory, use <tt>rm -r [directory]</tt> at your own risk.<p>

<tt>pwd</tt><br>
Tells you the name of the current directory.<p>

<b>File Commands</b><p>

<tt>rm [filename(s)]</tt><br>
Deletes the specified file(s). Once a file is deleted, it is gone forever. Be especially careful when using wildcards with this command.<p>

<tt>cp [filename(s)] [directory]</tt><br>
Copies the specified file(s) to the specified directory. Keeps the originals intact.<p>

<tt>cp [filename] [newname]</tt><br>
Creates a copy of the specified file with a new name.<p>

<tt>mv [filenames(s)] [directory]</tt><br>
Moves the specified file(s) to the specified directory. The originals are destroyed.<p>

<tt>mv [filename] [newname]</tt><br>
Renames the specified file to the given new name. You can also "rename" a file into another directory by specifying a name in that directory.<p>

<b>Filenames and Directories</b><p>

<tt>~</tt><br>
The tilde is always the name of your home directory, so typing <tt>"cd ~"</tt> will bring you to your home directory.<p>

<tt>/</tt><br>
The forward slash is used as the top directory for the system and also to separate the names of subdirectories. For instance, <tt>"cd /user/mallen"</tt> says to start from the top of the directory tree (<tt>"/"</tt>), go into the subdirectory <tt>"user"</tt> and then into the subdirectory <tt>"mallen"</tt>.
<p>

<tt>*</tt><br>
The asterisk is used as a wildcard when naming files. For instance, <tt>*.scm</tt> will match all the filenames that end with <tt>".scm"</tt>.
