PSET1 - Monkeys in the Filesystem 

1. Create a directory in /tmp/ called unix-course.
   Remember your root password?  Become root, and create a file
   named "I am owned by root" in your directory, unix-course.  As
   your regular user id, edit this file to contain the name of your
   favorite food.  Note that you fail.  Without becoming root, rename the
   file to "i_am_owned_by_root".  Note your success.  Why can you rename
   the file, but not edit it?

2. Create a subdirectory in unix-course named A, and a subdirectory B
   in A.  Set the permissions on A such that any other user can access
   files in A, but cannot list the files in A.  Become the "nobody" user
   to verify that it behaves as you expect (nobody is a powerless local
   user created for times when a process should run with minimal
   permissions.  Note, though, that nobody has no password.)

3. Create an empty file named -\\\\
   Rename it to be ~//// .  Just kidding.  You can't do that.  Rename
   it to ~\\\\ .

4. Do you still have your java files?  Find the total numbers of lines of
   Java code that you wrote.  Hint: use find, wc.
