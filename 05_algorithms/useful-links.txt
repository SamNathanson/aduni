Here are some web-sites that might be useful
if you'd like extra solved problems to work on.
One is a student-run web-site for the algorithms class
at berkeley that has sample exams from 1993-2000
with solutions for the most recent years.

The second is for an algorithms course at Carnegie Mellon
that has problem sets with solutions and some sample exams.

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-f00/www/



And there are a couple of really fun sites
which both have nifty interactive applets
for trees, graphs and sorting.
