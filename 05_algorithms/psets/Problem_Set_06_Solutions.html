<h3> Problem Set 6 - NP-Complete Reductions </h3>

<b> 1.  Reductions 

<p>

(1a)

<p>
Hamiltonian Path <= Hamiltonian Circuit </b>

<p>

Modify your graph by adding another node that has edges to all the nodes
in the original graph.

<p>

If the original graph has a Hamiltonian Path, the new graph will have
a Hamiltonian Circuit:  the circuit will run from the new node to the
start node of the Path, through all the nodes along the Path, back to
the new node.

<p>

If the original graph does not have a Hamiltonian Path, there can be
no Hamiltonian Circuit in the new graph: <br> 
(1)  There is obviously not one starting from the new node.  (No edge 
from the new node can lead to a Path through the graph which allows 
a return to the new node.) <br>
(2)  There is no possible Circuit starting from any node in the original
graph.  This is because, at best, the new node would create a Path, but
not a Circuit, in the new graph.  If there is no Path in the original,
there are at least two "gaps" between nodes that would have to be
bridged to create a Circuit.  Adding the new node could only, at best,
bridge one of these, to create a Path but not a Circuit.

<p>

<b> Hamiltonian Circuit <= Hamiltonian Path </b>

<p>

Modify your graph, say: 

<p>
<center>

</center>
<p>

and add new nodes thus:

<p>

<center>
<img src="fig2.gif" alt="other graph example">
</center>

<p>

The Start node can be connected to any node in the original graph (in this
case N); the AlmostThere node must be connected to all nodes originally
connected to N.

<p>

If there is a Circuit in the original graph, there will be a Path in the
new graph from Start to Finish:  follow the Circuit from N to the last node
in the Circuit before returning to N (either P, Q or R in the example), then
go through AlmostThere to Finish.

<p>

If there is no Circuit in the original graph, there can be no Path from
N to P, Q or R, so there can be no Path from Start to Finish.

<p>

<b> (1b) Not All Equal 3SAT <= Set Splitting </b>

<p>

Make the set-to-be-split contain all the variables in the NAE3SAT formula
and their negations.  For each variable-negation pair ((x, ~x), (y, ~y)
etc) make a subset.  Also make a subset for each clause (eg (x + ~y + z)).
The set-to-be-split can be split in the required way if and only if
the formula has a truth-value assignation that makes it true.  

<p>

<center>
<img src="fig3.gif" alt="set split">
</center>

<p>

One part of the split set represents "true", the other "false".  Each
subset must contain one "true" variable and one "false" variable, which
is exactly what the satisfiability problem requries.

<p>

<b> 2.  More Reductions 

<p>

(2a) Vertex Cover <= Independent Set </b>

<p>

All of the nodes that are NOT in a graph's minimum vertex cover form
that graph's maximum independent set.  The independent set can't be 
smaller, because certainly no two nodes in it are connected (if they
were, one of the nodes would have to be in the vertex cover).  The
independent set can't be bigger, because each node in it is connected
to one of the vertex cover nodes.

<p>

<b> (2b) Independent Set <= Clique </b>

<p>

Construct a new graph that "inverts" the original: ie has edges where
there weren't any and doesn't have them where there were; eg

<p>

<center>
<img src="fig4.gif" alt="IS->Clique">
</center>

<p>

A set of nodes is an independent set in one graph if and only if it is
a clique in the other, so finding the maximum clique in the new graph
finds the maximum independent set in the original.

<p>

<b> (2c) NAE3SAT <= 4-colorability </b>

<p>

This figure is rather complicated.  It was invented by several members of
the class (not including me - I have merely written it up):

<p>

<center>
<img src="fig5.gif" alt="really complicated graph">
</center>

<p>

Some points to note about a possible 4-coloring for this:

<p>

The two nodes at the top are connected to all of the variable nodes and
to each other, so they must each be a different color, and no variable
can be either of those colors.  Call these two colors the Dummy colors.

<p>

Each variable is connected to its negation as well as to the two top 
nodes, so we must have two other colors, not the Dummy colors, to color
the variables.  Call these the Truth-value colors.  No variable and its
negation can have the same Truth-value color.

<p>

The two bottom nodes are each connected to the two top nodes, and to each
other, so they must use both of the Truth-value colors.

<p>

Each of the three outside nodes in the 4-node clause triangles connects to
a variable node (so that each variable in the corresponding clause connects
to one of these nodes).  The middle node of each triangle is connected to
each bottom node, so the middle node must be a Dummy color.  This leaves
the other Dummy color and the two Truth-value colors as candidates for
coloring the three outside nodes.  (All four colors must be used, as each
clause triangle is fully connected.)  If the outside nodes are connected to
variables that all have the same Truth-value color, we cannot use this
color in the triangle, so there is no successful coloring.  So in any
successful coloring, the outside nodes must be connected to variables of
both Truth-value colors.

<p>

Bearing these points in mind, convince yourself that the given formula
is NAE3-satisfiable if and only if there is a 4-coloring for the
corresponding graph.

<p>

<b> 3. The Clique Problem 

<p>

(3a) </b>

<p>

Check every subset of 4 nodes to see if they're all connected to each
other.  (Dumb but polynomial...)

<p>

<b> (3b) </b>

<p>

There are n-choose-4 subsets, or O(n^4).  For each subset, there are (at
worst) 4(n-1) edges to check, or O(n).  This is O(n^5).  (This is using
adjacency list representation.  With matrix representation, the number
of edges to check for each subset is constant, which would give O(n^4).)

<p>

<b> (3c) </b>

<p>

No planar graph can have a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 (by Kuratowski's
Theorem).  So the maximum clique for a planar graph is at most 4.  We
have a polynomial-time algorithm for finding size-4 cliques (and size 3,
and size 2).  So clique for planar graphs is not NP-Complete.

<p>

<b> 4.  The Coloring Problem </b>

<p>

No node in a graph of maximum degree <= 2 can be connected to more than
2 other nodes, so its minimum coloring can be at most 3 colors.  We can,
eg, DFS for strongly connected components (certainly polynomial).  Each
component is either an isolated node, a chain, or a ring.  We can also
check for cycles in such components in polynomial time.  If a component is
a ring, count the nodes: an odd number needs 3 colors, an even number only
2.  If a component is a chain (more than 1 node, but no cycles) it needs
2 colors.  If it's an isolated node (degree 0) it needs 1 color.  A
particular graph's minimum coloring is the number of colors required by
its most color-hungry strongly connected component.

<p>

<b> 5.  Partition Revisited

<p>

(5a) </b>

<p>

Partition when the sum of the numbers is a perfect square is still
NP-Complete.  We can reduce ordinary Partition to Perfect Square
Partition:

<p>

First: of course odd sums don't have a solution.

<p>

For even sums, if we have:

<p>

(1) x1 + x2 + ... + xi = n,

<p>

we can convert this to:

<p>

(2) y1 + y2 + ... + yi = n^2, where y1 = n*x1, y2 = n*x2 etc.

<p> 

If (1) has a partition = to n/2, (2) has the corresponding partition =
to n^2/2.  If (1) does not have such a partition, neither does (2).

<p>

<b> (5b)

<p>

Partition <= Subset Sum </b>

<p>

Obviously.  Set B = 1/2 * SUM(s(a)).

<p>

<b> Subset Sum <= Partition </b>

<p>

Find some number Q such that B + Q = 1/2(n + Q), ie Q = n - 2B,
where n = SUM(s(a)).

<p>

Add Q to the original set, the sum of which is now n+Q.  We can partition
the new set if and only if there is some subset of numbers in the original
set that sums to B:

<p>

(Subset sum of original set) implies (partition of new set):  The set that
sums to B, with Q, form a partition.

<p>

(Partition of new set) implies (subset sum of original set):  There are
two partitions, one that contains Q and one that doesn't.  As Q + B = the
partition sum, all the other numbers in Q's partition sum to B.

<p>

The reduction of Partition to Subset Sum implies that Subset Sum is
NP-Complete in general because Partition is NP-Complete in general.
However, Partition, which is a special case of Knapsack, can be solved
in pseudo-polynomial time; therefore, given the reduction of Subset Sum
to Partition, so can Subset Sum.

<b> 6. The ADU Seating Problem

<p>

(6a) </b>

<p>

Input: directed graph (nodes are students; arrows from a student to any
student that student can stand).

<p>

Question: Are there two Hamiltonian Circuits in this graph, such that one
exactly reverses the order of the nodes in the other?

<p>

<b> (6b) </b>

<p>

Hamiltonian Circuit for any graph with nodes <= degree 3 is NP-Complete.

<p>

<b> (6c) </b>

<p>

From any node, DFS until the first previously seen node is reached.  If
you've hit all the nodes by this time, you've got a Hamiltonian Circuit.
Check the nodes in reverse order to see if there's also a Circuit the other
way.
