A basic introduction to the Calculus and Linear Algebra.  The goal is
to make students mathematically literate in preparation for studying a
scientific/engineering discipline.  The first week covers differential
calculus: graphing functions, limits, derivatives, and applying
differentiation to real-world problems, such as maximization and rates
of change.  The second week covers integral calculus:  sums,
integration, areas under curves and computing volumes.  This is not
meant to be a comprehensive calculus course, but rather an
introduction to the fundamental concepts.  The third and fourth weeks
introduce some basic linear algebra: vector spaces, linear
transformations, matrices, matrix operations, and diagonalization. The
emphasis will be on using the results, not on their proofs.
