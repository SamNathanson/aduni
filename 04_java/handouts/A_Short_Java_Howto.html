<h3>A Short Java How-to</h3>
<h4>How to compile a class</h4>
From UNIX shell, run:
<pre>
javac MyClass.java
</pre>
Or, if you need to specify a classpath other than the default:
<pre>
javac -classpath mypath MyClass.java
</pre>
This should produce a class file MyClass.class. The javac compiler
will try to (recursively) locate and compile any classes used by the 
compiled class. However, don't depend on it to recognize that the
source (.java) and object (.class) files are out of sync for any class.
Either remove all .class files before compiling, or use <code>make</code>.
You will save yourself a lot of frustration.

Note: The javac compiler is pretty insistant that the file MyClass.java contain
the class MyClass.

<h4>How to run a Java program</h4>
To run a Java program, you call the Java runtime with the class containing
the <code>main()</code> for your function. No extension is required on
the class name.
<pre>
java  MyClass
</pre>

<h4>How to time a Java program</h4>
It is occasionally interesting to find out exactly how slow a Java program is.
You can do this by runnint the UNIX <code>time</code> command.
<pre>
time java  MyClass
</pre>
This will display user, system, and total elapsed time used by the process
(in a more or less unreadable format).

<h4>How to specify a classpath</h4>
This is somewhat system specific but in UNIX it is generally a list of
directories, and/or .jar files separated by ':'. (If ':' doesn't work,
try ';' and remember to enclose in "" to avoid the semicolon from being
interpreted by the shell.)
<pre>
javac -classpath "foo:.:/user/me/classes/:libdir/goodstuff.jar"  MyClass
</pre>
Note that .jar files, being archives, look like paths to javac.

<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.2/docs/api/index.html">Java 1.2 API</a>:
Beautiful documentation for many Java classes and interfaces from the
class libraries. You can also get the Java 1.3 documentation as well.
<p>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.2/docs/index.html">Java 1.2 Doc Homepage</a>:
A list of links to Java documentation.
<p>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/index.html">Java 1.3 Doc Homepage</a>:
A list of links to Java documentation.
<p>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/index.html">Javadoc Homepage</a>:
A list of links to documentation on Javadoc.
<p>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">java.sun.com</a>: Java home page at Sun. You can
find lots of stuff from here (eg servlet API documentation), but it's harder
than you'd think.
<p>
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>: An excellent resource. If you are
stuck, type in your question (or it's keywords) and go. I find it the best
question answering system and best overall resource on the Web. To find
information on some programming structure, problem or utility, try searching
on "mytopic tutorial" or "mytopic reference". Ex. Searching on "java threads tutorial" will find a lot useful information on how to use threads in Java.
<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/make-3.77/html_mono/make.html">Some documentation on GNU make</a>: Tedious, but useful.

Bruve Eckel is the author of Thinking in Java, Thinking in Patterns, and several other books. The Thinking in Java book is a good complement to the Core Java book
used in class. TIJ2 is available from free in HTML or PDF from this site (which
is a good reason in itself to go buy it). [Note: I consider TIJ2 and Core Java 
to be the two best Java book out there. I think the Core Java is a better
reference and overview (which is why I chose it for the course),
while the TIJ is probably a better beginning tutorial and OOP manifesto.]
