<h3>Stream I/O</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
Up until now, we have been working with programs that call classes
manipulate data and occasionally print something out. We have been
building classes and testing them with fixed values. The is a limit
to how useful such a program can be as it has limited interaction
with the outside world. In the next few lectures we are going to
deal with how to get information into and out of our programs.
<p>
Today we are talking about Stream IO, which will allow use to
read from and write to files and  terminal windows (as well as
networks connections as we'll see next week).
<p>
The Java stream library is particularly (and unnecessarily) complex,
so we will first discuss the general properties of stream IO. Then
map these ideas onto the Java implementation.
<h4>Where does stream input come from (or go)?</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Files
 <li>Terminal Window: a special mechanism to handle typed input and display
output.(Emulates the notion of CRT's connected to computer through serial
ports.)
 <li>Network connections
 <li>Printers and other device (audio, USB, modem).
 <li>Other programs (as in UNIX pipes '|').
</ul>

<h4>Stream semantics</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> Streams (in the most general sense) are a very common model of
I/O. The basic ideas of Streams are supported in most environments (even if
they are not called such).
    <li> The basic idea of a data stream can be visualized as some
sort of pipe or hose for data. Your program has one end of this pipe, while
the other end is connected to the file or device you are interacting with.
Your program pushes data input the pipe and it (can be read from the other
end). Your program can also remove data from the pipe and use it.
    <li> The primitive form of data supported by streams is usually bytes.
Any more complex data type characters, Strings, integers, objects, etc. must
be built up from bytes. This opens the issues of data formats which we will
address laters.
    <li>There are 4 basic operations associated with streams which you
should find in any implementation: open,close,read,write.
    <li> stream = open(device or file name)
     <ul>
     <li> Creates a new stream (sometimes implemented with a construction
rather than an open() routine.)     
     <li> Arguments will depend on what sort of device is geing opened
     <li> Returns error code or throw error if can't open
     </ul>
    <li>close(stream); -- closes the given stream. Closed streams
are no longer available for reading and writing.
    <li>num = read(byte[] buf,int nbytes, Stream stream)
     <ul>
     <li> reads up to 'nbytes' worth of data (bytes)  from the stream into
buf.
     <li> Returns number of bytes actually read.
     <li> Read data is removed from the stream, the next read will get 
different data (pipe metaphor).
     </ul>
    <li>num = write(byte[] buf,int nbytes, Stream stream)
     <ul>
     <li> writes up to 'nbytes' worth of data (bytes)  from buf to the
stream.
     <li> Returns number of bytes actually written.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Blocking:</b> If we are reading from a terminal window, network
or another program. It may happen that there is no input in the stream
to be read (for example, nothing has been typed to the terminal). In
this case most read() implementation will wait for some input to appear before
returning. It is said to be "blocked". This is convenient as the
program does not has to handling this case any differently, on the
other hand it has implications which we will encounter later.
    <li> The write(), open(), and close() operations can also block. This
is rare when dealing with local files, but common when dealing with
network connections or other programs.
    <li> Sometimes a program does not want to block (because then it is stuck).
Most stream implementation provide an method (in Java called 'available()')
that indicates whether there in any data in the stream to read.
  <li><b>Buffering</b> Sometimes a program wants to read bytes 1 at a time.
However, that underlying mechanism for reading bytes from the Operating
System (the ultimate source) is pretty expensive, and we would like to read
data in large chunks to minimize this overhead. To do this most
stream implementation provide "buffered" reads and writes, which internally
read and write large chunks  from the operating system to maximize
efficiency, yet let the programmer read and write (to the buffer) 
in whatever sizes are convenient. In many stream implementations, buffering
is hidden or implicit, in Java it is explicit.
  </ul>

<h4>Data Formats</h4>
In general, we do not want to read and write uninterpreted bytes. We are
interested in reading higher-level datatypes, integers, floats, characters,
object, text strings etc. This leads to the problem of how to read bytes 
and assemble them into the datatypes we are interesting in. In general,
to do this we need to know how the data is stored in the file we are
reading (or produced by the source we are reading from).
<p>
Note on binary format: You may be used to looking at text files. However,
store large amounts of numerical or inunterpreted data (such as compiled
code) is very inefficient. For example, a Java int take 4 bytes of memory
in binary form, if we store it in text form, it will take about 10 bytes.
Hence, non-text data is often stores be directly dumping the memory
representations into a file. These are known as <em>binary</em> files.
<p>
For example, an integer in Java is 4 bytes. This would usually be stored
as 4 consecutive bytes in a file, so we can read 4 byte to construct our 
integer. However, in which order should the bytes be assembed? It turns
out different machines and systems organize this differently. In some
languages, such as C, one actually has to assemble all of your datatypes
by hand from bytes, and worry about what type of machine they were
originally written on. Fortunately, Java saves us much of that work
(at the price of complexity in the number of stream classes).
<p>
This problem of data formats occurs in text strings as well. Many text
files in Western systems are stored using 1 byte per character. For
Western alphabets, this works fine and there are standard encodings,
such as ASCII and Latin 1). For non-western language, such as Chinese,
we been more bytes per character and the encoding becomes more complex.
</ul>
<h4>The Java stream library</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>
The Java stream classes as found in the packages java.io and must
be included with the line
<pre>
import java.io.*;
</pre>
  <li>The Java system is quite complex. Some of it is explained in detail
in the book. Some of it you just need to get from grovellin over
the online documentation and trying things out (sad, but this is often the
way of things). We can only try to give an overview of the structure
and a road map to using it.
  <li>Separates basic streaming, buffering, and data conversion into
       separate classes. Complete hierarchy is on pages 698-699.
  <li>One must glue together a pipeline of classes to do the desired
IO function.
  <li>Flexible, not a gentle slope system. Simple things are not very simple
to do.
  <li> The complexity of the Java library can be somewhat reduced by
thinking of it as split and duplicated along several dimensions. (Most
other systems have more general mechansims which do not require this many 
classes)
  <li> The first split is between reading/writing binary data and text
data. Internally, Java uses a 2-byte character encoding known as Unicode.
Since this is different from the encoding of the majority of text files, 
Java must do special format conversion on reading and writing, hence
the distinction.
  <li> The second split is between reading and writing (input and output).
many system don't explicitly separate these and streams can be used for both.
Java however does.
  <li> The result of the first two splits is 4 top-level classes.
  <ul>
  <li><code>InputStream</code> -- binary input
  <li><code>OutputStream</code> -- binary output
  <li><code>Reader</code> -- text input
  <li><code>Write</code> -- text output
  </ul>
  <li> Unfortunately, we are not done yet. These are really abstract class.
In order to do anything useful, we must instantiate a subclass of one
of these (sometimes several). Java provides scads of these with different
functionality.
  <li>One thing we haven't walked about is how to connect the other end of the
stream. Java provides a number of classes to do this (in groups of 4 based on 
our split). The most important is probably the File versions (<code>
FileReader, FileWriter, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream </code>) which
open a file to use as the other end of the stream.
  <li> The FileInputStream etc constructors will all through errors
if the file cannot be opened (for whatever reason).
  <li>Java also provides analgous classes to connect to compressed files
(ZIP and gzip), and other programs, and Strings (very handy sometimes).
  <li> Some of the IO classes merely add additional functionality, in
which case the other end of the stream is connected to a more primative
stream. 
  <li>One of these features is buffering, Java provides (again 4) different
classes for buffering IO. These should always be used (for efficiency) unless
there is a good reason not to.
  <li>Another feature is reading/writing binary data types. Java only
provides these in binary versions (natch) not text version. These
classes are <code>DataInputStream</code> and <code>DataOutputStream</code>.
( which implement the <code>DataInput</code> and <code>DataOutput</code>
interfaces respectively). These classes support methods such as
<pre>
       int readInt();   // on DataInputStream -- write an int in binary format
       void writeInt(int n);   // on DataOutputStream -- read an int from binary file
</pre>
An analogous methods for other basic data types.
  <li>Finally, there is a nice utility class that knows how to
print various datatypes as text string (as opposed to first converting
them to strings in your pgm and writing the strings). This is the
PrintWriter class. It has methods such as 
<pre>
       void printFloat(float f);  
</pre>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Some examples</h4>
<pre>
Read a line of input from the terminal and print it back.

  InputStream in1 = System.in; // get InputStream from system, byte stream
  InputStreamReader in2 = new InputStreamReader(in1); // adds Unicode conversion
  BufferedReader instream = new BufferedReader(in2); // add buffering

  // BufferedReader support readLine() so we can get a line (strips newline)
  String line = instream.readLine();
  System.out.println(line); 
</pre>
<pre>
Read binary data from a file (note try/catch to handle IOExceptions)

  try{
   DataInputStream in = 
        new DataInputStream ( 
           new BufferedInputStream(
              new FileInputStream("infile.bin")));
   
   int data = in.readInt();
  }
  catch(IOException e){
    // code to handle IO exceptions (no file, etc)
  }

</pre>


<h4>Tokenizing</h4>
One other class that is useful enough to be worth mentioning in StringTokenizer.
This class will break up a text line into a sequence ot words (or a sequence of
tokens separated by some other character). See description in book.
<h4>File and directory manipulation</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Java has a class File that directly manipuilates files and directories.
  <li>It can test for existance, return protections, test type, create, delete.
  <li>It can also deal with directories: Creating dirs, notion of current dir, home dir
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recitation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finish 'common tasks' and file/dir calls if not done
in lecture.
</ul>
