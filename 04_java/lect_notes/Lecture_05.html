<h2>OOP Design and Design Process</h2>
<h3>Lecture</h3>

<h4>The very high level view</h4>
There are two classes of 'customer' that need to be satisfied
in the software development process. 
<ul>
<li>The producers: developers, designers, and project managers
<li> and the consumers: users, clients, paying customers.
</ul>

These groups have very different concerns. 
<ul>
<li>User concerns
  <ul>
  <li>Efficiency: Program speed, and memory usage.
  <li>Reliability: Software runs with no bugs and minimum maintainance.
  <li>Feature Completeness: It does what the user wants.
  <li>Schedule and Price: Software is available when needed
and not too expensive.
  </ul>
<li>Project Manager ( and Developer ) concerns
  <ul>
  <li>Programmer Efficiency: Project gets completed on schedule,
or at least before it gets cancelled.
  <li>Maintainability: Bugs can be fixed and new versions can be released 
without constant attention from original development team.
  <li>Extensability: Software can be easily improved, and extended
  <li>User satisfaction: The users concerns are reasonably met.
  </ul>
</ul>

All programming methodologies and tools, including OOP primarily 
address the need  of the project managers and developers (who not 
coincidently who the methodologies and tools are sold to).

<h4>The high level view</h4>

What ideas do we have to achieve the goals described above?
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation: Hiding the implementation of functionality 
from the users (callers) of that functionality. This greatly
improves maintainability separating functionality
into well defined units, preventing changes in one
part of the code to unexpectedly break other parts.
<li>Abstraction: This improves reliability, extensability, and maintainability
by minimizing code duplication and reducing the total amount of code
(in general, less code, fewer bugs, more code, more bugs). There are
several types of abstraction:
<ul>
<li> abstracting data through class hierarchies,
<li> factoring out common code into subroutines (methods)
<li> factoring out common code into parent class methods.
<li> writing algorithms in terms of abstract types or interfaces and
using polymorphism
</ul>
<li> Error checking and minimization: Compile-time test for bugs, avoiding
unsafe language constructs.
<li> Programming style and Documenation: A well written program is a story
explaining itself to future developers, as well as an effective implementation
for users.
</ul>
<h4>The view from Java</h4>
What tools do we have to support these concepts.
<ul>
<li>Strong Typing improves reliability by catching some bugs at compile time.
<li>Sequestering data in classes instances and limiting access with
'private' and 'protected' helps support encapsulation and isolation of
implementation and use.
<li>Polymorphism, inheritance and interfaces encourage the abstraction in
algorithms implementation for maximum code re-use.
<li>Interfaces encourage encapsulation by completely hiding implementation.
<li>Inheritance encourages factoring of common code onto parent classes.
<li>Inheritance concentrates data specification and representation decisions
(only have to maek/change them on superclass, not all subclasses)
</ul>

<h4>OOP Design: Object Relationships</h4>

One of the skills to learn in OOP design is when to use inheritance vs
interfaces. Diceding whether something shoulf be a subclass or instance
variable. etc.
<p>
While there are no hard and fast rules. There are some general principles and
advice. One key is to think about the relationships of the objects involved.
There are (at least) four major relationships in OOP programmion:
IS-A, HAS-A, USES, and BEHAVES-LIKE. The meanimg of these relationships
is exactly what it is in English.
<ul>
<li>Two things, X and Y are in the IS-A relationship simply if the
phrase "X is a Y"  or "all Xs are Ys" makes sense (and is true). 
Objects in an IS-A relationship are good candidates for inheritance 
as in <code>class X extends Y</code>.  For example, A Duck is a Bird, so
a Duck class might inherit from a Bird class.

<li>Two things, X and Y are in a HAS-A relationship if Y is a property or
componment of X, as in the English phrases "X has a Y", or "Y is a component of
X". If X HAS-A Y, than Y will probably be an <b>instance variable</b> 
on class X. The HAS-A relationship does NOT indicate inheritance.

<li>If we can say "X uses Y", Than we have a USES relationship. This usually
means that methods in X call methods on Y. The instances of Y used by methods
on X can either be instance variable on X, or passed as arguments to methods on
X.

<li>The BEHAVES-LIKE relationship is similar to IS-A but not as strict.
BEHAVES-LIKE relationships are usually implemented with <b>interfaces</b>.
For example, a Bird behaves like a FlyingThing, in that it
has some properties associated with FlyingThing (airspeed, for example).
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>Software Development Process (part 1)</h4>

In the remaining time, we will examine the design process for a
small to medium size system, one with no major subsystem capable of
being built by one or two people is a short amount of time. We will
discuss the design process for multi-module system, and larger teams
later in the course.

<h4>Design</h4>

Maxim: "Think first, program last"
<p>
The "think first" part of the development process is also known an the
design stage. In this stage we need to plan out what we need to build
without actually building it. The OOP design process is pretty much
the same as any other, except it places a greater emphasis on data. In OOP
design, the class hierarchy comes first, then the algorithms (methods).
<p>
There are several stages to the design process. To make them concrete we
will develop a running example: writing the game Tetris. At first glance,
this is a daunting project. We shall see if we can make it more managable.
<p>

Our design process will be mainly top-down, in that we will design our
system in terms of classes and methods we wish we had, then we will
implement those classes and methods. (Occasionally, a bottom-up approach
is called for, especially when a method or algorithm looks like it
will be difficult to implement. In this case it might be worthwhile
to implement the trouble spots and see how this implementation affects
the design so far.}

<ul>
<li> Step 1. Write out, in English or pseudo-code, what the program is supposed
to do, and what the main operations are.
For Tetris:
<ul>
<li> A new block starts at top of well
<li> The block falls until it contacts squares in the well, at which
point it stops and joins the squares in the well
<li> User input from keyboard can shift or rotate falling block. However,
block is restricted to stay in well and also cannot penetrate squares.
<li> When block stops falling, any complete row is deleted from well
<li> Remaining blocks in the well are compacted downword row by row.
<li> User score is based on difficulty level and number or rows cleared.
<li> Of course, all of this action must be displayed on the screen.
</ul>
This is starting to look reasonable.
<p>
<li> Step 2. Object (class) Level Design: What are the major classes in
the design and what do they represent. In the Tetris case, we case come
up a few.
<ul>
<li> The Well is naturally a class. It maintains the current state of the
squares and falling block. 
<li> Squares are another natural type (if minimal). The represent the
squares in the well, and their main property is color.
<li> Blocks are another good class. They represent the falling block and
maintain it's color and orientation. Should a Block's position be
kept on the block itself on the Well class...not sure yet.
<li>WellPanel:
<ul>
<li> Our Well keeps the state of game in an abstract form convenient for 
computation. However, we also need to display it.
<li> One common <b>Design Pattern</b> (re-usable idea for program organisation)
is called the Model-View-Controller pattern. 
The idea is to separate the internal representation of data from the way 
it is displayed and/or modified. This makes it easy for  the same data to 
be displayed in multiple ways (as in the diffent file views in the
file tree walker (Explorer on Windows)). It also makes it easy to
parameterize the display.
<li> We will isolate our display knowledge in the WellPanel class. We call
it WellPanel because in Java, it will inherit from JPanel.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li> Step 3. Instance data and method type: Once we have our classes
we can fill in the methods and some of the instance data we think we will need.
At this point we are not doing any implementation. For Tetris
<pre>
public class Well{
   /*
    * The array of squares, (null represents an empty square)
    */
    Square[][] squares;
   /*
    * Dimensions of well
    */
    int wellWidth;
    int wellHeight;
    Block block; // the current falling block

   /*
    * Detects collisions between block and squares in well.
    *  Used to stop falling blocks and prevent illegal shift and rotations
    */
    public boolean collision(Block b);

   /*
    *  Start a new block falling
    */
    public void startBlock();

   /*
    * Checks well for complete rows and deletes them (null's them out)
    * @return Number of rows cleared (for scoring)
    */
    public int clearRows();
   /*
    * Compacts squares in well downward
    */
    public void compact();

}

public class Block{
   int type; // type (shape) of block
   int color; // color code, shered between block and display class
   int orientation; // rotation
   int height; // current hieght in well - 0 == bottom
   int xpos;   // current x position o == far left
    
   /*
    *  Rotate left or right
    */
    public void rotate(int direction);

   /*
    *  Shift left or right
    */
    public void shift(int direction);

   /*
    *  Decrement height one unit
    */
    public void drop();

}

The Square types consists only of a 'color' property and an accessor.
The Display stuff we won't worry about (until Friday).

</pre>

This list pretty much completes our design. Things are looking pretty
under control. Except for the collision() method and the representation
of block shapes and orientations, everything looks pretty straightforward
to implement.
<p>
<li> Step 4. Implementation: Here we flesh out our data representations
and implement our methods. In order to minimze bugs and stay sane, we
want to implement and test incrementally. The general order is:
<ul>
<li>Implement constructors for classes
<li>Implement test driver and some display/print/toString method. Test
constructors.
<li>Add new methods one by one, from less complex to more. Test each
method as it is implemented.
<li>Implement utility methods that other methods in this class 
depend on first, and test them independently.
</ul>

</ul>
