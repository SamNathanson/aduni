<h2>OOP in C and C++</h2>
Although, Java is currently alive and well in server-side Web programming and
making some inroads in the business middleware area, C and C++ are currently
the languages of choice for high-performance and desktop software. Outside
of the Web programming industry, C/C++ skills along with VB skills are still
important in the job market. In this lecture, we give a brief overview
of C and C++ concentrating on the differences between these and Java.
Our main goal will be to explain how to use the OO design and implementation
techniques we learned in Java to other environments.
<p>
Historically, C++ was developed as an OO extension to C. However, since we are
already familiar with OOP principles, we will be working backward in history
starting with C++ then discussing OOP in C.
<h3>OOP C++</h3>
The good news is most of the syntax we learned in Java applies directly to C++
(the Java developers wisely copied C syntax rather than gratuituously invent
something different). The main differences are in features, semantics,
and terminology (C++ gives different names to things like instance variables,
we will continue to use Java terminology here).
<ul>
<li> Global procedures. Unlike Java, in which all procedures (even main())
must be methods in some class, C and C++ allow procedures to be defined
ourside of classes. These are equivalent to <code>public static</code> methods
in Java, though they do not require the Classname.methodName syntax to call
them.
<li> Hello World in C/C++. The follow program is Hello World in both C and C++
(since C is a subset of C++, a program can be legitimate in both).
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  printf("Hello World\n");
}
</pre>
Some notable differences between this and Java
<ul>
<li> The #include directive: This causes the compiler to to look for a
file called <code>stdio.h</code>. These <em>header</em> files are common
in C/C++ and contain the declarations of classes and procedures without
their implementations. They are somewhat similar to Java interface definitions
or the definitions of pure abstract classes. This separation of definition
and implementation of classes and methods is one of the differences between
C/C++ and Java programming.
<p>
The header <code>stdio.h</code> defines procedures in the standard C IO
library with includes <code>printf</code>, a formatting print utility.
<li> The main() procedure is not enclosed in any class. Public static 
procedures can be defines at top level (as can public static data, though this
is almost always a bad idea).
<li> The arguments to main() are an int, and a char**, rather than a
String[] as in Java. C/C++ does not have a native String class (though C++
has a library version). Strings are represented as character arrays
terminated by a 0. For now, think of char** as representing an 
array of character arrays, the int argument, argc gives the number of elements
in the array of strings.
<li> To compile this program, one runs the C or C++ compiler. The C compiler
on UNIX is usually called CC, the various C++ compilers have different names.
g++ is the gnu C++ compiler.
<pre>
g++ -o Hello Hello.c
</pre>
This should produce two files Hello.o, the object file corresponding to
Hello.c (this is roughly analagous to the .class file), and Hello, an
executable. Typing Hello on the command line should now invoke this
program.
<li> There are actually two things going on in the g++ command above,
compiling, which converts the text .c file to a binary code .o file, and
linking, which combines a number of .o files and libraries into an executable.
In Java, the linking step usually happens while the program is running, in
C/C++ it usually happens as a separate step.
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Defining Classes in C++</h4>
<ul>
<li> Class definition and implementation are similar in C++ and Java. One 
difference is that the definition (instance variables and method declarations)
are usually separated into a .h file 
(the extensions .hpp or .hxx are also used, no meaning is attached to the 
extension itself). For example, our Vect2D class in C++ would have a .h file
like
<pre>

class Vect2D{
  // instance vars, not different syntax for access specifier
  private:
     double x = 0;
     double y = 0;
  public:
     // Constructor, has class name as in Java
     Vect2D(double x, double y);
     // A public instance method
     double length();
}
</pre>
<li> The implementation of the instance methods would be in a separate 
file usually, but not necessarily called Vect2D.cpp (or .cxx or .C).
The implementation of the constructor and length() would look like
<pre>
#include "Vect2D.h"   // We need to include the definitions

// Constructor 
Vect2D::Vect2D(double xx, double yy){
   x = xx;
   y = yy;
}

double Vect2D::length(){
   return(sqrt(x*x) + y*y);
}
</pre>
<li> Note use of the <code>::</code> scoping operator. This is how C++
keeps track of which class' <code>length</code> methods you are trying
to implement. In Java, this is not needed as implementations are always
within the class definitions. In some ways, the C/C++ separation of
definition and implementation gives you another level of encapsulation.
<li> It is possible to implement the methods in the .h file as in Java.
Often, short methods such as accessors and mutators are implemented there.
The C++ compiler is smart enough to <em>in-line</em> function defined in
the .h file and avoid the overhead of a function call.
</ul>
<h4>Using Classes in C++</h4>
<ul>
<li> Instantiating classes in C++ is slightly different than in Java. In Java,
all class instances are allocated from the heap using <code>new</code>. In C++,
instances can be allocated on the stack.
<pre>
Vect2D v1; // instantiate a Vect2D on the stack, calling default constructor
Vect2D v2(2.0,3.0); // instantiate a Vect2D of stack calling constructor;
</pre>
Note in Java, that statements above would merely allocate references set to
<code>null</code>, in C++ the instance itself is allocated from the stack.
This is somtimes convenient as C++, unlike Java does not have GC, so
all class instances must be explicitly reclaimed. Stack allocated instances
follow stack allocation priniciples are are automaticly reclaimed when the
stack frame is popped.
<li> To access an instance methods on an instance, we use the Java-like syntax
<pre>
double len = v1.length();
</pre>
Note that although the syntax is identical, this is subtly different from
Java as v1 is the instance itself, not a reference.
<li> Reference access and heap allocation is so useful that C++ supports it
as well. Unlike Java, which has only references to instances, C++ explicitly
distinguishes references to objects with a '*':
<pre>
Vect2D v1; // instance of Vect2D
Vect2D* vp = NULL; // reference (pointer) to instance of Vect2D 
</pre>
<li> Instances are allocated from the heap with <code>new</code> as in Java.
<li> Instance variable and methods are accessed from reference (pointer)
variables with the -&gt; syntax;
<pre>
vp = new Vect2D(2.0,3.0); // alloc a Vect2D from heap
double len = vp-&gt;length(); // call length method through reference
</pre>
<li> Since we need to explicitly manage storage in C++, at some point we
must free this instance. The syntax to do this is
<pre>
delete vp;  // delete instance pointed to by vp
vp = NULL;  // A good idea, otherwise vp points randomly into heap.
</pre>
<li> There is an additional problem here. What if Vect2D as one of
it's instance variables, held a reference to another heap object? The
delete call only delete's the structure it is given, it does not explicitly
recurse. To allow the cleanup and freeing of objects, C++ has a companion
method to the constructor called the <em>destructor</em>. Like the
constructor, the destructor for a class has a standard name. the class name
preceded by '~', thus the destructor fro Vect2D would by ~Vect2D().
<li> The destructor an called on an instance when the instance is about
to be destroyed, either through an explicit call to delete, or when a stack
allocated instance is freed due to a stack pop (ie procedure return).
<li> Storage management in C/C++ is tedious and difficult and it is easy to
make a mistake. Mistakes usualy manifest is crashes (if you try to use
something you previously deleted), or leaks (you are not freeing everything
you should) which cause the process to grow in size as it runs.
</ul>
<h4>Inheritance in C++</h4>
<ul>
<li> You can extend classes in C++ as in Java. Though the syntax uses ':'
rather than 'extends'.
<pre>
class Complex: public Vect2D{
}
</pre>
C++ has a complex syntax for calling the constructors of superclasses (as
we did with super() in Java). Refer to C++ books if you are interested.
<li> Unlike Java, multiple inheritance is allowed.
<li> Public methods and instance vars are inherited from parent class as
expected.
</ul>
<h4>Polymorphism in C++</h4>
<ul>
<li> Unlike in Java, inherited methods do not support polymorphism by default.
This is to allow in-lining of methods and improve efficiency.
<li> Methods can be explicitly declared to support polymorphism with
the keywork virtual, as in
<pre>
class RFunc{
  public:
    virtual evaluate(double x);   // declare evaluate to support polymorphism.
}
</pre>
<li> To indicate the equivalent of a Java <code>abstract</code> function,
on that has no implementation on the parent class, the syntax
<pre>
class RFunc{
  public:
    virtual evaluate(double x) = 0;   // pure virtual function, no implementation on parent class
}
</pre>
<li> A C++ class containing only pure virtual functions and no instance
variables, is roughly equivalent to a Java interface (or pure abstract class).
</ul>
<h4>Other C++ Arcania</h4>
<ul>
<li> By default, C++ uses call-by-value as in Java and C. Instances and
pointers to instances are passed by value. For instances, this means
the instance is <em>copied</em> onto the call stack, modifications to
an instance argument will NOT modify the original. Since it is
occasionally useful to be able to support modification of instances passed
as arguments without passing an explciti pointer, C++ also
supports call by reference. This is never strictly required, but occasionally
useful. See any C++ text for further explanation.
<li> C++ also supports <em>templates</em>, which is essentially a way
to parameterize and abstract classes and procedures by type. The syntax and
usage of templates is fairly complex, refer to C++ texts for more (or better
yet, stay away from templates all together).
<li>Unlike Java, C++ allows classes to override operators 
(+,-,*,[],-&gt;, etc.) as well as methods. This allows objects to be 
manipulated with the language's expression syntax rather than explicit method
calls. As neat as this sounds, it adds complexity and rarely improves clarity.
<li> C++ does not have the extensive runtime class library the Java does
for GUI, Stream io, networking, etc. These elements are external to the 
language and are provided by thrid party librareis (unlike Java which is 
a world unto itself). However, newer versions of C++ come with the 
Standard Template Library (STL) that convers some of the functionality
of the java.lang and java.utils packages. Unfortuately the STL makes use
of all of the more complex and obscure feature of C++, and can render a program
unreadable by all but STL adepts. In addition, there have been
portability problems with STL-based programs. Although STL has it's devoted
fans, my inclination is to avoid it.
</ul>
<h2>OOP in C </h2>
<ul>
<li>
C is the ancestor of C++ (and in many ways Java). It was developed at Bell
Labs in the 70's for system programming and has outlived many other languages
of that era. The advantages of C is that it is minimal, reasonably portable,
and transparent, it hides little of the underlying machine architecture.
As a result, C programs can be made very efficient in CPU and memory, and
can even by tuned to take advantage of particular memory or processor
architectures (at the cost of portability).
<li>
C is a minimal procedural programming language. It does not support classes
or method calls, there are no templates or call-by-reference. 
All procedure are essentially public static.
<li> C does, however, support structured data types called 
<code>struct</code>s. These can be thought of as the data (instance variable)
part of classes. No methods allowed.
<li> For example we could represent the data part of Vect2D as
<pre>
struct Vect2D{
   double x;
   double y;
}
</pre>
<li> Struct's can be allocated off either  the stack or heap as in C++.
Although C has no <code>new</code> or <code>delete</code> keywords. Instead,
low-level library calls are made to do the heap allocation.
<pre>
struct Vect2D *vp = NULL; // a variable to point to a Vect2D struct
vp = calloc(1,sizeof(struct Vect2D)); // allocate from heap with lib call
</pre>
<li> C does not support access restriction on structs, all instance vars
(sometimes called members) are public.
<li> However, just because C does not support access restrictors, classes,
etc, is no excuse for porr programming (although the opportunity is there).
Programming in C should proceed along the same lines as in Java.
<ul>
<li> Determine the class types needed and their instance variable and
methods (avoid polymorphism if possible as it is more difficult to implement).
<li> Use struct's to hold class data. (it is possible to write C code so
that the struct implementation is hidden from all users, almost as if it
were private).
<li> Implement methods on these data types by hand. Remember a method
call (sans polymorphism) is mostly a procedure call with a hidden first
argument. in C you must supply this argument explicitly. Furthermore,
you must develop naming conventions that append the 'class' name to the
method name (since C, unlike Java and C++, has a flat namespace for procedure).
<li> A 'method' implementation for Vect2D might be
<pre>
Vect2D_length(Vect2D* vp){ /* pass in instance var explicitly, by pointer */
   /* implement method functionality accessing instance vars on struct */
   return(sqrt((vp->x)*(vp->x) + (vp->y)*(vp->y))));
}
</pre>
<li> Despite all members of a struct being public, you should always implement
and use accessors and mutators from outside your 'class' methods
rather than directly touching the structure.
<li> Inheritance can be emulated in C in several ways, although you may have 
to get a little nasty with pointers and casting. However, many C-based window
system Widget API's which use inheritance, do exactly this. (Though most
have the grace to hide it.).
<li> Even polymorphism can by implemented in C. Polymorphism in Java anc C++
is implemented by associating with each instance a table of functions. 
Polymorphic method names are converted to indexes into this function table.
When a method call on a particular instance is executed, the function
table for that instance (actually these tables are shared among the 
instances of a class), used to find the proper functnio to execute.
<p>
Since C has teh ability to store pointers for functions as a basic data type,
and the ability to calla function from such a function pointer. It is
straightforward (though not always fun) to explicitly duplicate the function
table mechanism and implement polymorphism by hand.
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Misc C facts</h4>
<ul>
<li>C does not have the extensive libraries of Java, nor the STL of C++.
It's library has basic streamIO capabilities (buffered and unbuffered),
formatted printing and input (very handy), simple string operators (which
operate on byte arrays) and math operations. Almost everthing else must
be built up by hand (although this sound overwhelming, in practice it is not
so, for any given project only a few data structure are needed and these
are straightforward, if tedious to implement.
<li> Probably the most difficult thing about C/C++ programming compared to
Java programming is the fact that heap storage must be explicitly
managed. This is both concepually difficult and extremely tedious to get right
in a complex program.
