<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<li>It is a general principle of OOP
and good programming in general to try to have each piece of
code or logical function appear only once. If you find a (as is often
the case), that similar code appears in multiple places, for example,
similar methods in different classes, try to factor the code so
it appears once. 
<li> One reason why this is a good policy is that when that algorithm or
functionalty must be modified or extended (as it almost surely will),
it only has to be changed in one place. There is no need to hunt through
the code to find (almost) all of the places to be modified.
<li>There are several mechanisms to support this sort of code re-use:
<ul>
<li>Abstraction: If you have a lot of sections of code doing similar things,
try to focus on what they have in common, and how to implement it so
that a simgle, more general implementation can replace several sections.
<li>Re-use through method calls: An example: the static and instance
methods on Vect2D do the same thing. One could be implemented by calling 
the other.
<li>Inheritance: todays'topic
</ul>

  <ul>
  <li>Inheritance is the (according to some) the essence of OOP.
  </li>
  <li>Inheritance allows common behavior and implementation to be 
factored out in parent classes and shared. Child classes only need to 
implement child specific functions. 
  <li>Child classes (or subclasses) inherit data and methods from
their parent classes (superclasses).
  <li>Child classes are more specific, parent classes more general.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
<h4>Inheritance in Java</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Use 'extends' keyword to indicate inheritance.
    <li>Example: Complex Numbers
   Complex numbers are mathematical entities of the for a+bi, where (i*i = -1).
   and a and b are real numbers. Complex numbers support addition, subtraction,
   abs, reciprocal. Since complex numbers can be considered points in a plane,
   we can inherit from Vect2D rather than starting from scratch.
<pre>
      class Complex extends Vect2D{

      }
</pre>

    <li>Child class inherits parent's public methods and instance vars.
<pre>
    Complex a = new Complex();
    Complex b = new Complex();
    Complex c = a.add(b);       // inherits add routine from Vect2D

</pre>

    <li>Parent instance referenced through keyword 'super'. In particular,
the parent's constructor is called as super(). Parent's constructor
must be explicitly called by child class constructor (otherwise empty
constructor is used).
<pre>
      class Complex extends Vect2D{

          Complex(double r,double i){
	    super(r,i);      // Call parent constructor
          }
      }
</pre>

<pre>
      Complex c = new Complex(1.0,1.0);   // new child call instance
      double abs = c.length();            // methods of parent are available
<pre>
    <li> For Complex, we want to rename some methods.

    <li>Method of child class CANNOT access provate vars of parent, must
use accessors, mutator.
<pre>
      class Complex extends Vect2D{

          Complex(double r,double i){
	    super(r,i);
          }

          // rename some accessors, must use parent's accessors as
	  //   parent's instance vars are private.
	  double getReal(){ return(getX();}
	  double getImag(){ return(getY();}
	  double abs(){ return(length();}
      }
<pre>

    <li> Child class can add additional methods. For example Complex numbers
support multiplication, division, and conjugation.
<pre>
      class Complex extends Vect2D{
          ...Constructor and accessors

	  // Multiplication by Vect2D
	  // Note: must change parent class to protected or..
	  //   use accessors.
	  public Complex mult(Complex b){
	    double real = (getX() * b.getX()) - (getY() * b.getY()); 
	    double imag = (getX() * b.getY()) + (getY() * b.getX()); 
	    Complex result = new Complex(real,imag); 
	    return(result);
          }

	  // Return Conjugate
	  public Complex conj(){
	     return(new Complex(x,-y));
          }

	  public Complex recip(Complex b){
	      double abs = abs();
	      Complex result = conj();
	      return(conj.scale(1/abs));
          }

      }
<pre>

  </li>
    <li>It is good practice to factor out common code in parent methods
even when overriding, and call from child class implementations.
    </li>
  <li>Inheritance is based on the 'is-a' relationship. For example:
birds,mammals, and reptiles are all vertibrates. The share common properties
and behavior as vertibrates as well as properties specific to their subclass.
  </li>
  <li>Another common relationship is the 'has-a' relationship. The
relationship between a whole and it's components. For example. bird have
wings,legs,color,habitat etc. Our Vect2D class HAS x and y components.
On the other hand, a Complex IS a Vect2D with some additional functionality.
Understanding these relationships is an important part of OOP and program
design.
  </li>
  <li>Issue: Of course there is always more than one way to carve up the world.
More than one possible hierarchy and the hierarchies are not necessarily 
consistant.(eg flying_animals -> birds,bats,insects). More about this problem
in next lecture. Using class inheritance we have to pick the most important
decomposition.
  </li>

    <li> One a single parent is allowed in Java (full multiple inheritance
is supported in C++ and CommonLisp...use with extreme caution).
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Polymorphism</h4>

<pre>
Child classes can also override the parent's methods. This is useful if,
       a) the child's behavior is slightly different form the parents or,
       b) certain behavior is not defined for the parent, but is for all
          child classes. In this case the method is usually defined in
	  the parent class, and overridden on all child classes.

Another example: Say we have a generic class for representing nodes
in a binary tree. Each node in the tree can have a left and right
descendent. Leaf nodes are merely tree nodes with no children.


abstract class ExprNode{
    private ExprNode left = null;
    private ExprNode right = null;
    public ExprNode();        // constructs leaf node (no children)
    public ExprNode(ExprNode l,ExprNode r);    // construct interior node
    public ExprNode getLeft();
    public ExprNode getRight();
    public void setLeft(ExprNode n);
    public void setRight(ExprNode n);
    public boolean isLeaf();   // returns true if no children
    // add later
    public abstract int evaluate(); // compute value

}

Now, say we want ot use this to represent and evaluate arithmetic
expression tree such as ((3 + 4) * (2 - 1)). 
We can represent this
as a tree where the interior nodes hold the operator and the
leaf node the literals. We need to extend ExprNode with 2 new types

/**
 * Node type for literal values
 */
class LitNode extends ExprNode{
   // instance var
   private int value;  // value for this node
   // Constructor
   LitNode(int value);     // always a leaf node
   public int getValue();  // accessor
}

class OpNode extends ExprNode{
   // Lame Java syntax for defining class constants
   // (note 'final' keyword, prevents assignment)
   static public final int PLUS = 1;
   static public final int TIMES = 2;
   static public final int MINUS = 3;
   // instance var
   private int operator;  // operator for this node
   // Constructor
   OpNode(int op,ExprNode l,ExprNode r);     // op must match one of above

}


Now we can build a tree

   // Note: we can use cariable of parent type to hold child. Java does
   //  explicit upcasting
   ExprNode t1 = new LitNode(2);
   ExprNode t2 = new LitNode(1);
   ExprNode tree = new OpNode(OpNode.TIMES,t1,t2); // build ( 2 * 1 )

However, we still need to add evaluate() routine to OpNode and LitNode.

class LitNode extends ExprNode{
   ... stuff from before...
   public int evaluate(){return value;}
}

class OpNode extends ExprNode{
 ...stuff ...
 public int evaluate(){
     // Unfortunately we still have to downcase, but the branch on
     // node type is no longer necessary
    ExprNode el = getLeft();
    int lval = el.evaluate();
    int rval = getRight().evaluate();   // shorter form
    if(op == PLUS) return(lval + rval)
    else if(op == TIMES) return(lval * rval)
    else    ....

 }
}

Even though we are referring to an instance with a variable typed
as the parent type (here ExprNode), Java remembers the complete type
of the instance. When we call a method on the instance, Java uses the
appropriate method for each instance subtype (as it we had cast to
it's actual type). This is called "polymorphism" and is much of
the power of inheritance and OOP.

We could further use polymorphism to remove the branching on operator
type. How?

<h4>Notes on  inheritance</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Implicit upcasting: A variable declared as a parent class can be assigned
an object from a child class (of course only methods defined on the parent
are available).
  </li>
  <li>All classes in Java implicitly inherit from the superclass Object,
which has a variety of methods including clone(), equals()
and toString(). These should be implemented by all classes. [Note: the default
equals() actually implements 'eq' (ie reference equality).
  </li>
  <li>Downcasting: can only downcast to true type of object, otherwise
Java throws an exception (and your program dies).
  </li>
  <li>Reflection: Objects can describe themselves. The information Java
       keeps about instances and classes is accessable to the programmer,
       mainly via the Class type Ex. Class.instanceOf() returns the type
       of an object.
