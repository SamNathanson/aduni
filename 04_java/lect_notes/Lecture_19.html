<h2>Persistence, Databases, and Transactions, XML</h2>
In many, if not all, large applications, there is a need for some data to
persist between invocations of the program. A simple example is the 
configuration information in our PS3 program. Scientific programs have
to store large numerical datasets. Enterprise, business,
and e-commerce applications particularly are organized around 
large amounts of stored information.
<p>
If the amount information to be stored is small and structured, a simple
flat text file representation will suffice. For large amounts of numerical
data, binary files are required and the format is usually application specific.
<p>
Occasionally, one want to save and restore a representation of the set
of objects in an OOP program. This is a little more difficult, since the
object can contain references to each other. These references are
memory addresses and will not be stable from one instance of the program to
another. The solution to this problem is straightforward (if tedious). One
essentially builds a dictionary or array of all the objects to be dumped,
convert all references to indexes or keys in this dictionary. the dump
both the dictionary and object contents (with now contain only basic types).
To reverse the process, one reads the datafile, building the dictionary and
creating the objects, the converts the indexes (or keys) back into references.
The <em>serialization</em> and <em>object stream</em> features of Java do this
automatically for you. In languages such as C, it must be done by hand.
<h3>Databases</h3>
The need for persistently storing large amounts of structured has been around
since computers were first applied to business processes. Businesses need
to store employee records, customer records, inventory data, account and
financial information, vendor information and more.
Gradually a set of best practices evolved on how to do this and these ideas
were incorporated and refined into subsystems callede database programs.
<p>
There is a full course on databases later in the year, and the Web course will
touch on them also. Here we will introduce them and focus on
the relationship between databases and object-oriented programming.
<p>
Most database programs provide at least 4 functions.
<ul>
<li> The persistent and reliable storage of structured information
<li> A  flexible and powerful way to query the database, update
the database, and analyze the database contents.
<li> Synchronized access to data so that multiple clients can
read and write data simultaneously 
<li> Robust access and update of database contents, so that is any
part of the system fails, the database will remain intact and consistent.
</ul>
<h4>Database Tables</h4>
The first of these is the most basic and if it is all a program
requires, can be implemented in flat file formats. Most databases
programs today are <em>relational</em> databases. This means they
store their data in a collection of tables of fixed formation. Each
table has a number of columns representing the name and type of the
data in that column. These correspond roughly to the instance variables
in an class declaration. Each row provides values for the column data
and corresponds conceptually to an object instance. Each table typically
has a column whose value uniquely identifies the row (the is usually
different from the row index since it must be constant across
resorting, addition, and deletion of rows). This column is often
called the <em>primary key</em> or primary reference. Using the primary
key as a column value, a row in one table can contain a reference
to an instance (row) in another table. Thus we can create the equivalent
of link object representations in our database.
<p>
What is missing from databases that we have in OOP? Primarily inheritance,
(which can be implemented by hand), methods, and polymorphism. Some attempts
have been made to bring the database model even closer to the object model
(ie object-oriented databases), but these have not yet replaced the
relational model.
<h4>Query Language</h4>
On of the features provided by databases is a query language to access,
and update the database. Since database access is a specialized operation,
higher level languages can be designed to perform this function more
easily than with basic programming languages like Java or C.
The database industry has eventually converged around a language called
SQL as a standard.
<p>
You will learn SQL in detail in your database course. Here is an example to
give you the basic idea.
<pre>
SELECT FirstName,LastName,Salary from EMPLOYEE
where (Salary > 10000) and (FirstName == 'Sam');
<pre>
When executed, this will return a subset of the EMPLOYEE table
having only the columns <code> FirstName,LastName</code>
and ,<code>Salary</code> and whose rows match the conditions in
the <code>where</code> clause. If type at a database console app, this
will print back something like:
<pre>
FirstName      LastName     Salary
----------------------------------
Sam             Nunn         12000
Sam             Digita       20000
</pre>
There are many powerful features of SQL, but this is the basic idea.
<h4>Synchronization and Robustness</h4>
This is what really pay the big bucks for in a database program. The previous
two features are fairly straightforward to implement (also query
optimization is a challenge). These last two are much more difficult.
<p>
We saw a little of the problem when we discussed thread synchronization.
Say we have two operations (these would actually be SQL statements)
on an account table, Deposit(account, amount), and Withdraw(account, amount)
in an environment where many user are reading and writing the database.
Say we also want to do transfers which Withdraw from one account , then
deposit into another.
As in the case of threads, we need synchronization operations to ensure
the update operations are thread safe. But we actually need much stronger
guarantees. We need <em>transaction</em> support.
<h4>Transactions</h4>
A transaction is a sequence of operation considered as a unit for which
a certain set of conditions is guaranteed. These conditions are often
referred to as the ACID conditions (or the ACID tests), based on their
names.
<ul>
<li>Atomicity - the sequence of operations either all take place or none
do. If there is a failure part-way through the sequence, the database remains
in the original condition. If the transaction succeeds, it is said to be 
<em>committed</em>
<li>Consistency - the database is transform from on valid state to another.
Users are allowed to define validity checks on database states (eg balances
have to be positive). If the transaction would result in an invalid
state, it is not performs and the database remains as if it were
never attempted.
<li>Isolation
The view of the database seen by each client is always globally consistent.
If client 1 is performing a transfer transaction, client 2 will either
see the database state before the transfer or after. Client 2 will never see
a database state that corresponds to a partial implementation of the
transaction (eg the withdrawal completed but the deposit not).
<li>Durability
Once a transaction is committed it remain independent of hardware, software,
or network failures. The database can always be restored to the current valid
state. (There are various levels of this guarantee, depending on how
widespread a catastrophe you want to plan for.).
</ul>
These guarantees define transactions. You will here much more about them in
weeks to come.
<h4>Database Access from Java: JDBC</h4>
It is often the case that databases not only need to be accessed from
console applications and report generators, but from programs as well.
This is particularly true in distributed and Web applications where data
must be extracted from the database, formatted and presented to the user.
In order to accomplish this database vendors provide programmatic interfaces
to their databases and client system provide facilities for accessing
databases.
<p>
The Java mechanism for accessing remote databases is called JDBC ( and is
more or less Java's answer to ODBC). While we won't into details here
(Volume2 of Core Java gives an introduction, there are several books that
cover the subject completely). Any database programming interface
(like JDBC) system must support the following operations:
<ul>
<li> Interfacing the client environment to the database. This requires
a JDBC driver for the particular database to be interfaced. These are
available commercially.
<li> Establishing a connection to a particular database and logging into
to establish privedges. The usually returns some sort of DB Connection object.
<li> Defining queries and SQL statements. These are usually objects as
well whose constructors take a SQL statement String as an argument.
<li> Executing statements on a connections and committing a sequence
of statements as a transaction.
<li> Parsing result tables from SQL queries back into the format of the
calling language.
</ul>
JDBC (now JDBC2) has facilities and classes for doing all of these things
and is fairly straightforward to use, once you understand the underlying model.
<h3>XML</h3>
It is probably worth saying a little about XML at this point as it is
currently a hot topic in the programming and Internet fields. 
In common, with OOP and Relational Databases, it is a representation of
structured data.
XML differs in purpose from OOP and Databases. It focuses on the transmission,
organization, authoring, and presentation of structured data rather than
the storage, transactions, or programming.
<h4>Data Description vs Presentation</h4>
One of the problems with HTML is that it is neither a complete
document (or data) description language, nor a very good page formatting
or UI generating language. The fact the Web pages look even as good as 
they do is a testament to the quality and energy of Web programmers.
<p>
XML attempts to correct some of the weaknesses in HTML in that it's
goal is to more clearly separate the concepts of data description and
data formatting and presentation. A text document in XML would be
entirely described in terms of document components (Chapters, sections,
headings, tables, footnotes, etc). An entirely different document, usually
called a <em>style sheet</em> would describe (often, but not always, also
in XML) how to format these structures for a particular display technology.
Structured data, for example the result of a database query, would also
be described in terms of its component data, separated
from any display and presentation information.
<h4>Syntax</h4>
XML is not really a language, but rather a syntax for languages. Each XML
application must define it's own application specific XML sublanguage to
operation. For example, XHTML is an XML compatible version of HTML and
MathML is an XML standard for describing mathematical formulas for display
in documents and Web pages.
<p>
The syntax of XML languages is a particularly simple. Like HTML, XML documents
consist of text plus <em>markup</em> elements describing the structure 
of the text.
The elements are contained in angle brackets. (Which means that angle
brackets in XML text must be escaped so they do not appear as markup. A
hassle with writing XML lectures in HTML.). Internally the elements
contain a tag and one or more attribute-value pairs. Example XML tags:
<pre>
&lt;picture src="url1" name="myname"&gt;
</pre>
Unlike HTML, the values must be given and enclosed in "". Also unlike
HTML each tag must have a corresponding close tag. Also, all element
names and attributes are case-sensitive.
<pre>
&lt;/picture&gt;
</pre>
The open and close tags must match in stack order. 
<p>
Inside any element (in between the open and close tags) one can have
text data with additional markup. The intent is that this data is
somehow describe by the enclosing tags.
There is a special syntax for tags with no enclosed text or data.
<pre>
&lt;picture src="url1" name="myname"/&gt;
</pre>
This is about it. Clearly this system can be used for describing the components
of text documents (books, articles, etc). It can also be used to describe
structed data as in out DB example above
<pre>
&lt;EmployeeList&gt;
  &lt;Employee&gt;
   &lt;FirstName&gt;Sam&lt;/FirstName&gt;
   &lt;LastName&gt;Nunn&lt;/LastName&gt;
   &lt;Salary&gt;12000&lt;/Salary&gt;
  &lt;/Employee&gt;
  &lt;Employee&gt;
   &lt;FirstName&gt;Sam&lt;/FirstName&gt;
   &lt;LastName&gt;Digita&lt;/LastName&gt;
   &lt;Salary&gt;20000&lt;/Salary&gt;
  &lt;/Employee&gt;
&lt;/EmployeeList&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Specification</h4>
To describe a particular XML application language, one must specify what the
element tags are, what attributes are allowed for each, and what their 
relationships are (what elements can element which other elements).
XML languages can be described in a text document, called a DTD, which
follows a standard syntax). Unfortunately, this syntax is not itself
XML (although is also have a lot of angle brackets. There is another
standard for describing XML languages called Schemas in which the language
description language is itself XML compatible.
<p>
The syntax of DTDs and Schema is tedious, although not difficult, so will
not present examples here. There are many books on XML that cover this
in great detail.
<h4>Parsing and programming</h4>
To operate on XML data within a program one needs a way to parse the
document into a data structure. Fortunately, this is fairly easy. In fact
oner of the benefits on XML is that it is easily parsable, since the
underlying structure of the XML document is a tree of elements and data.
XML is in fact, self-parsing, all that is really needed is a means
to convert the text representation into a set of datatypes.
<p>
There are two standard interfaces for parsing and manipulating XML
in programs: SAX and DOM. SAX is an event-based model the processes
the document serially. It allows the programmer to override 
processing methods that get called each time a begin or end tag is encountered.
The DOM parser produces a tree structure in memory representing the
document and provides an interface for accessing the this tree structure
(which looks like standard tree methods, with addition methods for
accessing attributes). DOM, by the way, stands for Document Object Model.
There are SAX and DOM libraries for C++ and Java available from Apache.com
Java also has a simplified version of DOM called JDOM.
<h4>Transformation</h4>
The another bit of technology that has grown up around XML is
transformation languages. There are two reasons for XML transformation.
The first is to keep the notion of document (or data) representation and
transform from one representation to another (performing expansions or
translations or re-organizations [for examples compiling table of contents]).
The other is to transform the data representation XML into a presentation
format (HTML, tex, PDF, XSL:FO, etc). 
<p>
There are several technologies for specifying and performing these
transformations. The older, and still current, technologies are the
style sheet systems that grew up around HTML, particularly CSS (Cascading
Style Sheets). These associate with each element type (possibly in
context) a display format (font, color, etc). Another system called
DSSSL, is used by the popular DocBook text document description language
(XML compatible).
<p>
Document transformations can be accomplished entirely with the XML milieu using 
XSL, and XSLT. XSL is an XML compatible type sheet and tree transformation
language. XSLT is a translator that takes an XML document and an XSL
style sheet and produces as new XML document. Associated with XSL is a display
formatting language called XML:FO which can be the final output of
such a transformation, though few systems now support display of
XSL:FO natively. The beauty of the all XML scheme is that both the
XSL style sheet and the original XML document can undergo multiple
levels of transformation before final re-transmission or display.
<p>
There is much more to be read about XML, much of it standards and details.
I refer you to the many books on XML, XML and Java, and to the Apache
Web site where a lot of interesting open source work is going on
in connection with Java and XML.
