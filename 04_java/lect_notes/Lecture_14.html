<h2>Misc. Topics in Java</h2>
<h3>Layout</h3>
Earlier, we discussed how to draw graphics, handle events, and use
GUI components. In doing so, we ignored an important issue: How to place
our GUI components in our windows to make an attractive and useful UI.
This process is called GUI layout and Java provides several alternative
strategies.
<p>
The key problem we are trying to solve is to keep the UI attractive and
useful for a variety of window sizes and shapes. If we do not
allow the user to resize the window (or resize it for different screen sizes),
we can simply specify the exact location and size for each component (we
will discuss how later).
<h4>Containers and Layouts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Java GUI components are added to and arranged on special component types called
Containers. the contentPane and JPanels are examples of container components.
<li> Associated with a Container object is a Layout object which controls
how components added to the container are arranged on the screen.
<li> A Layout is an object and the particular Layout for a container can be set with the method <code>setLayout(Layout l)</code>
<li> Java provides the following Layout subclasses
<ul>
<li>FlowLayout
<li>BorderLayout
<li>GridLayout
<li>BoxLayout
<li>GridBagLayout
<li>null
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Flow Layout</h4>
<p>
The flow layout is the default layout for JPanel. The flow layout arranges
the widgets in rows, according to the order of addition. Components are
added to each row until no-more can fit, then another row is started. Rows
are filled from top to bottom. The components within a row are center
aligned by default. When the frame window is resized, the flow latout
recomputes the position of the components based on this algorithm.
<p>
<h4>Border Layout</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Border Layout divides the container into five regions. North, South,
East, West, and Center. When components are added using the Border Layout,
the add() method takes a second argument, a String indicating the area
this component is to be assigned to.
<li> A problem with the border layout is that it tends to grow all the 
components is each area to the size of the area. It the lays the out
on top of each other. Not very useful.
<li> In order to make the BorderLayout useful, one needs to use a JPanel
as the primary component in each area, then add the components to be laid out 
into these JPanels (using FlowLayout or some other Layout).
</ul>
<h4>Grid Layout</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Grid layout arranges components on a grid of equal-sized rectangles.
The size of the rectangles depends on the size of the largest component
to be laid out.
<li> The number of cells in each dimension is specified in the
constructor of the GridLayout.
<pre>
    GridLayout grid = new GridLayout(3,4);
    setLayout(grid);
</pre>
<li> As components are added to the grid layout, they occupy cells
starting from upper left, filling a row at a time.
</ul>
<h4>Box Layout</h4>
<ul>
<li> The box layout comes in two varieties, horizontal and vertical.
<li> The box layout arranges components in a single row
or column, depending on the type of box.
<li> There is a Box container class that supports this layout and
some convenient static methods. Use static <code>create...</code>
methods on Box rather than constructors.
<li> The Box class has static methods that create <em>struts</em>,
fixed size spaces, and <em>glue</em>, expandable space that grows and
shrinks as the surrounding frame resizes.
<pre>
	Box[] boxes = new Box[3];
	boxes[0] = Box.createHorizontalBox();
	boxes[1] = Box.createHorizontalBox();
	boxes[2] = Box.createHorizontalBox();
	// add buttons and glue
	for(int i=0;i&lt;11;i++){
	    boxes[i%3].add(buttons[i]);
	    if(i%2 == 1)
		boxes[i%3].add(Box.createHorizontalGlue());
	}
	// stack hboxes in vbox with a 50 pixel strut and glue
	vbox.add(boxes[0]);
	vbox.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(50));
	vbox.add(boxes[1]);
	vbox.add(Box.createVerticalGlue());
	vbox.add(boxes[2]);
</pre>
<li> Horizontal and vertical boxes can be nested to form columns of
rows and vice versa. Though the layout within each box is independent
of the others (ie not aligned).
<li> The Box layouts essentially implement the layout model used in
many text formatter and text layout systems such as Tex. Tex composes
a pages as a layout of vertical and horizontal boxes. (eg each paragraph
is a vbox, each line is an hbox).
</ul>
<h4>GridBag Layout</h4>
<ul>
<li> If the Box layout implements the typical layout algorithm on text
formatters, the GridBag layout implements the typical table layout
algorithm found in HTML, or Tex, or Word.
<li> The area is divided into a grid of cells based on
a number rows and columns. The rows and columns do not have to be of equal
size (but life is simpler is they are).
<li> For each component to be added, a GridBagConstraints object must
be created. This specifies the starting x and y position of the
component in terms of cell location (0,0 is upper left). It also
specified the width and height in terms of cells. It can also
specify whether components should grow to fill the cell or
remain at their preferred size.
<pre>
    // utility method to create and set up constraints
    public GridBagConstraints makeConstraints(int x, int y, int w, int h){
	GridBagConstraints c = new GridBagConstraints();
	c.weightx = 100;
	c.weighty = 100;
	c.gridx = x;
	c.gridy = y;
	c.gridwidth = w;
	c.gridheight = h;
	c.fill = GridBagConstraints.BOTH;
	return(c);
    }
</pre>
<li> The GridBagConstraints object is included as a second argument
to the add() method when adding components to a container using the
gridbag layout.
<li> Unlike the box layout, components are globally aligned, not just
in individual rows and columns. Unlike the Grid layout, the cells do
not have to be uniform size, and components can span multiple cells.
</ul>
<h4>null Layout</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sometime you just don't want to fool around with getting  Layout
managers to do what you want. You can always drop back and punt by setting
the Layout on a container to <code>null</code> and positioning and sizing
each component by hand using the
<code>setBounds(int x, int y, int w, int h)</code> method on the components.
</ul>
<h3>Packages</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the
number of classes in a program grows, the chances or name collisions
between classes increases (where are only so many interesting class names).
This is particularly true when the  classes are developed by multiple people 
or provided by outside vendors. A programmer has no way of telling whether 
a class name has been used or will be used by someone else on the project.
<li>Most programming languages provide a mechanism to divide up name spaces
so that class names (and procedure names in non-OOP languages) don;t conflict
across divisions.
<li>Packages are the mechanism in Java for separating namespaces.
<li>Package names are dotted string as in <code>java.io</code>
<li>To include the classes in a file into a package, the line
<pre>
package my.package.name;
</pre>
must be the first non-comment line of the .java file.
<li> Classes without a <code>package</code> line are put into a default
unnamed package.
<li> Classes in packages can be referred to by their full path name. 
For example, <code>java.io.FileInputStream</code>. To save typing, the
<code> import</code> line, makes a public classes in a package
available for reference by their internal name. This is the meaning of the
lines
<pre>
import java.io.*;
import javax.swing.*;
</pre>
that we have used on many of our programs.
<li> Only the public classes of a package are available for outside
access. These must be declared <code>public</code> is their definition.
By default, classes are given package scope.
<li> One might notice that putting classes in packages only moves to name
collision problem to package names. What prevents two people from using the
same package name? In fact, nothing in the technology solves this problem,
however, by convention a strong attempt is made to use unique package
names. Java recommends using an organization's URL in reverse as the
prefix for a package name. Thus my package for LayoutTest might be:
<pre>
package org.aduni.javacourse.lecture14;
</pre>
That ought to be unique!
<li> A disadvantage of these longer package names is that Java mixes
package names and file system address in an unfortunate way. Java will
attempt to find the class 
<code>org.aduni.javacourse.lecture14.LayoutTest</code> in the file
LayoutTest.class in the
directory <code>org/aduni/javacourse/lecture14</code> relative to
the CLASSPATH (or current directory). 
<li>
The java compiler does not copy your class files into the correct place, that
is the responsability of the user.
<li> Clearly, this naming scheme can be a nuisance as is requires
these deep directory hierarchies which may not be the way one wants
to organize the system during development.
<li>Fortunately, we are (somewhat) saved by JAR files.
</ul>
<h3>JAR files</h3>
<ul>
<li> JAR files are ZIP compressed archive files (analogous to .tar.gz files
in UNIX, but different format).
<li> A JAR file can archive a compete directory hierarchy of classes into
a single file.
<li> In addition to class files, JAR archives can contain a special
<em>manifest</em> files with meta-data about the archive that can be used by
various programs.
<li> Jar files are created with the <code>jar</code> command which has
command line arguments similar to UNIX tar. If I had just compiled my
LayoutTest program in the current directory (but specified package
</codepackage org.aduni.javacourse.lecture14</code> in the sources),
and wanted to create a JAR file. I would create the needed subdirectories,
then
<pre>
cp *class org/aduni/javacourse/lecture14
jar cvf LayoutTest.jar org/aduni/javacourse/lecture14/*.class
</pre>
This will create LayoutTest.jar with all of my classes having the
proper relative pathnames.
<li> The nice thing about JAR files is that the java command will search
the path structure of a JAR file for classes with having to expand the
archive in place. However, the JAR file does have to be put into the class 
path. Thus
<pre>
java -classpath LayoutTest.jar LayoutTest
</pre>
should runt the LayoutTest program from within the JAR file.
<li> The JAR file manifest has a number of properties that can be set.
Many of the are relevant to using the archive as an applet, JavaBean, EJB,
etc.
<li> The Main-Class attribute specifies the class in which java should look
for main. This allows us to packages up a collection of classes into
something that looks (almost) like an executable program. A sample manifest 
file, <em>manifest.mf</em>to do this is
<pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: org.aduni.javacourse.lecture14.LayoutTest
</pre>
<li> Manifests are included into a JAR using the 'm' option to jar
<pre>
cp *class org/aduni/javacourse/lecture14
jar cvfm LayoutTest.jar manifest.mf org/aduni/javacourse/lecture14/*.class
</pre>
Note: the order of the 'f' and 'm' tags must be the same as the outputfile
and manifest file arguments
<li> With this archive I can now run my program as
<pre>
java -jar LayoutTest.jar
</pre>
<li> Try putting your SameJava game into a package, then into a self-executing
JAR file.
</ul>
