<h3>Window Systems and Graphics</h3>

<h4>Introduction: Window Systems, some history</h4>
<ul>
   <li> UP to now, we have been writing console apps
   <li> Model of interaction based on 1980 (or before) technology: 
       a character terminal connected (via serial line) to a shared
       processor. The terminal send key presses to the computer, which
       sends backs characters to display. A small step away from
       printer based teletypes.
   <li> Early 80s saw introduction of graphic workstations (commercially)
     <li> Window systems were developed to manage screen areas and new input
         devices
     <li> window systems divide the screen in rectangular areas which are
        associated with processes/programs.
     <li> Initially, this merely supported multiple virtual character
        terminals.
   <li> Eventually, more elaborate Window systems were developed. Apple
       Mac was an early commercial example, though this was based on
       the Xerox PARC Alto research (and indeed all of the ideas of the
       modern desktop had been demonstrated back in 1968). Windows followed
       pretty much along the lines of the Mac. At MIT the X window system
       was developed along slightly different lines, planning for network
       connectivity and distributed client/server applications from the
       beginning. Lately the Linux community has come up with a number
       of X-based Gui environments include KDE and Gnome/GDK
     <li> Development of libraries of configable GUI components (usually
         called widgets): buttons, menus, dialogs, text input, sliders. etc
     <li> These widgets had higher level interaction semantics, ie a button click
</ul>

<h4>Window Systems</h4>

<h5>Frames and Components</h5>

When we look at the screen of a typical window system, we see a collection
of rectangular regions which I will call <b>frames</b>. 
Each frame corresponds to a program
running on the system, though the mapping is not one-to-one. Each program can
have 0, 1, or several frames associated with it. By typing or mousing, 
we can send input to the program associated with the current frame. The program
can respond by drawing text or graphics in its frames (or creating new ones).
<p>
Each frame is often subdivided into a number of rectangular areas, which I will call
<b>components</b>. Examples of components are buttons, menus, menubars, text input
fields, and areas in which text and graphics are drawn. These components often
have particular behavior in response to mouse clicks, etc. However, these
components are bound in some deep way to the enclosing frame. For example,
all components of a frame move together when the frame is moved.
<p>
We can also use the mouse to move a frame around, resize the frame, Iconify the
frame, kill the frame, select a frame, bring a frame to the foreground so
it is not covered by other frames, etc.

<h5>Window Systems and Operating Systems</h5>

There is a tremendous amount of technology behind the scenes that is making this
picture work. For each frame, three different entities are interacting to
produce the behavior we see on our screens: the program attached to the frame,
the operating system, and the <b>Window System</b> which is mediating between them.
<p>
Each program is only responsible for the contents of its own frames. It is
in general, not resposible for where they are on the screen, whether they
are on top or buried, etc. Each program wants to treat its frames as a
collection of rectangular areas, independent of any other program's frames.
<p>
The operating system is responsible for managing attached hardware. In particular,
the mouse, the keyboard, and the screen. It tracks low level motion, click, and
keypress events, and sets pixels on the screen to particular colors.
<p>
A digression--<b>Pixels and Screens</b>: The image on your screen is made up 
of a rectangular array of dots which can be set to some color by the computer's
graphics hardware. These dots are called <em>pixels</em>. Depending on the
computer, monitor, and graphics card, the screen will consist of different
sized arrays; for example 1024x800 pixels, 1600x1200, 480x760.
<p>
The <b>Window System</b> is an entity that mediates between the operating
system and the programs to manage the global resources of screen, mouse, and
keyboard, while giving each program the view that it is connected to a mouse,
keyboard and some number of frames. It is the window system that is responsiable
for placing frames on the screen, moving them, iconifying them, killing then,
selecting them, uncovering them etc. It also decides which frame--and therefore
which program--each mouse event and key press belongs to. The main abstraction
the Window System supports is called, naturally, a <b>Window</b>. Windows
correspond to rectangular areas of the screen managed by the Window Systems.
Both the <em>frames</em> and <em>components</em> discussed above are windows.
In a typical application, each button, menu, scrollbar, etc. is its own window.
(At least in most implementations; sometimes there are attempts to cheat for
efficiency).
<p>
Frame windows are generally treated specially by the window system in that
they are given borders, and a title bar with close and iconify icons, and
all the other stuff for moving and resizing. (Of course a program
can request this stuff be turned off).
<p>
Inside a frame, a program's windows are organized hierarchically. This
hierarchy usually follows geometric enclosure. Child windows appear inside
parent windows. Note: this hierarchy of windows is NOT the inheritance
hierarchy of the various window types.
<p>
In general, the program is responsible for drawing the contents of
its windows and reacting to mouse and keyboard events appropriately.
For windows of common functionality, like buttons, there are libraries
that support this functionality so it doesn't have to be duplicated. Some
of these implement GUI components, and are often called <em>widgets</em>.
There are other window types whose sole function is to organise the layout of
their children. These are usually called <em>container</em> or <em>layout</em>
windows.

<h5>Windows in Java</h5>

OK enough background. Let's write a program in Java that creates a frame
Window.
<p>
The Java class that will do this for us (using the Swing GUI implementation)
is <code>JFrame</code>. We will subclass <code>JFrame</code> to make a frame
with the behavior we want.

<pre>

// Need to import these
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.geom.*;

/**
 * Basic code to put up a frame.
 */

class MyFrame extends JFrame{

    public MyFrame(){
	setTitle("MyFrame");
	setSize(200,200);        // size in pixels, must set: defaults to 0,0
	// Magic to get program to quit on Frame window close
	setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    }

}

public class FrameTest{

    // OK let's have our main() create a frame.
    public static void main(String[] args){
	// Create new frame
	MyFrame myframe = new MyFrame();
	// Show frame
	myframe.show();
    }
}

</pre>

<p>
When I compile and run this program, it opens a frame whose size is 200x200 pixels
with title "MyFrame". Notice I can move it, resize it, iconify it, close it; it
appears in the taskbar, I can lower or raise it. All without doing any work.
The Window System handles it all for me. Is this cool or what?

<h5>Scaling and Size Issues</h5>

When I created this frame, I made it the fixed size 200x200. On my office screen,
which is about 1000x800 pixels, this takes up about 1/20 of the screen area. On
a smaller screen, say 400x600 pixels, is would take up 1/6 of the screen. This
is important to remember any time you are writing a GUI application. It may be
run on a number of different screen sizes and you should do your best to
make it work well on all. Java ( and most Window systems) have facilities for
querying the size of the screen, so you can size your window appropriately.
<p>
Sizing issues go beyond how big to make the frame window. Clearly you can fit
more stuff into a 400x400 window than a 200x200 window. The application developer
must decide how best to adjust to the smaller area, whether to scale everything,
pack things close together, or simply omit things. This issue also appears
when the user resizes the window. The program must adjust to the new size to make
it look good (or simply not allow re-sizing).

<h5>Drawing</h5>
Today's topic is graphics, so let's draw something. It is poor form
to draw directly into the JFrame. What we need is a component for drawing into.
In Java Swing, this component is usually JPanel. Again we must subclass
JPanel to make a panel that behaves the way we want.

<pre>
class MyPanel extends JPanel{

	public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
	    super.paintComponent(g);
	    g.drawString("Hello World",50,50);

	}

}
</pre>

<ul>
<li>In order to draw onto our JPanel, must override the paintComponent()
method of JPanel to call the drawing routines we want.
<li>
The paintComponent method is called with a Graphics context object as its
argument. The system produces this so we don't have to worry about creating
it. This object holds information about the current drawing style (line
width, color, etc). It also knows about the calling panel and performs
clipping to panel boundaries. The Graphics and related Graphics2D class have
methods for drawing shapes, text and Images.
<li> One of these is the drawString() method we call above.
<li> In order to use MyPanel in our application we need to instantiate
one in main() and add it (as a sub-window) into the frame. This is done my the
code shown below. (The book explains why the ContentPane stuff is required.
For now, just treat this as an incantation to copy and use).
<li> Note that we have to call super.paintComponent() before we draw.


<pre>
public class FrameTest{

    // OK let's have our main() create a frame.
    public static void main(String[] args){
	// Create new frame
	MyFrame myframe = new MyFrame();
	MyPanel mypanel = new MyPanel();
	// Random stuff we just have to do (the book explains, kind of)
	Container contentPane = myframe.getContentPane();
	// add panel
	contentPane.add(mypanel);
	// Show frame
	myframe.show();
    }
}
</pre>


<li> When we compile and run this program, our frame now has Hello World
in it. Notice when we cover up the frame, or minimize it, the Hello world is
still there when we uncover the frame. 
<p>
This happens because the our paintComponent() method is called by the 
WindowSystem when a window needs to
be repainted due to being moved, uncovered, de-iconifyed, etc. 
We can see that this is happening by adding a System.out.println() to
our paintComponent() method. The Java
model (and the model of most systems)  is that the programmer is responsible
for refreshing graphics; the window system does not buffer or remember
the current contents. We will learn more about how this happens tomorrow.
<li> We set the coordinates 50,50 into the drawString() method. Note:
<ul>
<li>These coordinates are relative to our current window (not screen, not frame)
in this case, our MyPanel.
<li>The origin (0,0) is in the upper left hand side of the window.
<li>The Y coordinate increases DOWNWARDS. This is the opposite of the normal
way to graph the x and y axes in mathematics.
</ul>
</ul>

<h5>More Drawing</h5>
<ul>
<li> In moving from version 1.2 to 1.3, Java re-worked the drawing routines.
The older version are attached to the Graphics class, use <code>int</code>s for
pixel values, and consist of methods like drawLine().
<li> The newer versions use a Graphics2D class ( a subclass of Graphics),
use <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> for pixel coordinates and
are implemented as separate classes. In order to use them, you must
instantiate one, set any properties you want on the Graphics object,
 then draw (or fill) it, using the draw() or fill() methods on Graphics2D.
<li> One property you can set is color. Colors are also objects in Java.
Colors can be chosen by selecting the mixture of red, green, and blue on a
scale of 0-255, for example (255,0,0) is bright red, (0,0,0) is black. Some
colors are predefined staticly.
<pre>
Color red = new Color(255,0,0);
Color blue = Color.blue;
</pre>
<li>To draw a line (useing the new stuff) you need the x and y positions of
the endpoints.
<pre>
Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g; // downcast Graphics object
Line2D line = new Line2D.float(100,100,150,150);
g2.setColor(red);
g2.draw(line);
</pre>
<li>To draw a rectangle (or ellipse) you need the coordinate of the
upper left corner, the width and height.

<pre>
Rectangle2D r = new Rectangle2D.float(120,100,30,30);
g2.setColor(red);
g2.draw();
g2.setColor(blue);
g2.fill();  // To draw a solid rectangle we call fill() rather than draw()
</pre>
<li>
<h5>Drawing Images</h5>
The ToolKit object, as the name implies, packages an assortment of useful
functions. One of them is creating Images, which can then be drawn with
the <code>drawImage</code> method.

<pre>
// use static method on ToolKit class to get the system-dependent ToolKit
//  to really use.
Toolkit kit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
Image im = kit.getImage("img01.jpg");
g.drawImage(im,50,50,null);
</pre>
<p>
More complex Image handling issues are discussed in the book.
</ul>
<p>
The only way to really learn to use these tools is to try them. Explore nad
have fun.
