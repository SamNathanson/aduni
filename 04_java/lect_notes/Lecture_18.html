<h2>Software Patterns </h2>
(or how not to re-invert the wheel)
<p>
One of the things that make experience developers more productive than
novices is have seen and solved many problems before. After seeing the
same problems over and over again, one builds a library of solutions
that work. The Design Pattern movement (if one can call it such) is
an attempt to write down and diseminate the well-known techniques and
patterns. one of the seminal works in the area is <em>Design Patterns
Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em> by Erich Gamma, 
Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (The Gang of Four). 
<p>
This lecture covers rapidly a number of common solutions or models for
program development. Some of these are reflected in the Design Pattern
book, other represent higher-level architecture models. The purpose is
to give a survey of some of the tools in an experienced developers
toolkit.
<h3>Data Structures</h3>
We will start with a brief survey of basic data structures. The efficient
implementation of data  structures is a topic for an algorithm course.
What we are concerned with here in the interfaces the structures
represent. If you have a situation that calls for one of these interfaces,
you are in luck. Many man-years of effort has been put into efficient
solutions.
<ul>
<li> <b>Dictionary</b>
Dictionary semantics support storage and retrival of information and object
by key, often, but not always a string. Examples of data structures with
dictionary semantics are HashTables and A-Lists. The basic dictionary interface
is:
<ul>
<li> insert(String (or Object) key, Object o);
<li> Object o = lookup(String (or Object) key);
<li> delete(String (or Object) key);
</ul>
<li> <b>Array Semantics</b>:
Objects are accessed by index (actually a subtype of dictionary with
integer keys). Examples are arrays, lists. Interface:
<ul>
<li> Object o = get(int i);
<li> set(int i, Object o);
</ul>
<li> <b>Stack</b>:
A stack is a data stucture that support last-in first-out semantics.
the basic interface is
<ul>
<li> push(Object o);  // push object on top of stack
<li> Object o = pop(); // remove and return object on top of stack
<li> Object o = tos(); // return object on top of stack WITHOUT removing
</ul>
Stack data structures and important for implementing recursion, parameter
and return value passing, and procedure calling along other things.
<li> <b>Set Semantics</b>:
Sets semantics are sometimes useful for manipulating collections of
objects. Basic interface:
<ul>
<li> Set s = createSet(Object[] members);
<li> Set s = union(Set s1, Set s2); // both unique and simple are useful
<li> Set s = intersection(Set s1, Set s2);
<li> boolean member(Set s, Object o);
</ul>
<li> <b>Trees</b>:
Trees are data structure consisting on nodes. Each node can have any
number of daughter nodes. All daughter nodes have a unique parent.
Trees are useful for representing searches, hierarchies, inclusion, etc.
Basic operations on tree(nodes) are:
<ul>
<li> Node n = getParent(Node t);
<li> int n = numChildren(Node t);
<li> Node n = getChild(Node t,int i);
<li> Node n = getNextSibling(Node t);
<li> Object t = getValue(Node n);
</ul>
<li> <b>FIFO Queue</b>:
These are data structure that have first-in, first-out semantics. That is
the structure remembers the order in which object were entered and serves
them in the same order. Uses of FIFO queues include event lists and
packet queues. This paradigm is also useful for passing streamed data
between two parts of a program (that might be consuming or producing
data at different rates).
<p>
A common implementation of FIFO queues
are circular buffers: an array is used to hols the data, and a write pointer
and read pointer are maintained. These pointers are incremented as
data is stored and removed respectively. When either pointer reaches
the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning. The trick is to
make sure the write and read pointers never lap each other. To enforce
this, the reader and/or writer might occasionally block when trying to
access the buffer.
<p>
Another common implementaion is doubly linked lists.
<p>
The FIFO interface is quite simple
<ul>
<li> insert(Object o); // insert into tail
<li> Object o = remove(); // remove from head
</ul>
<li> <b>Priority Queue</b>:
We saw priority queues in PS1. The are data structures into which data
is inserted in any order, but it is removed in sorted order. These
are useful in schedulers (always remove highest prioiity job first).
The interface is standard queue:
<ul>
<li> insert(Object o); // insert 
<li> Object o = remove(); // remove largest (smallest)
</ul>
<li> <b>Graphs</b>:
There are many interesting algorithms based around graphs, and graphs
are a natural representation of many sorts of data (map data for examples).
Graphs are basicly a set of circles connected by lines. The circles are
called nodes, the lines are called edges. There is a subclass of graphs
called Directed Graphs or Digraphs. These are circles connected by arrows.
<ul>
<li> Node[2] nodes = getNodes(Edge e);
<li> Edge[] edges = getEdges(Node n);
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Creation Patterns</h3>
Creation patterns deal with how to create and assemble objects. Some examples
<ul>
<li> <b>Factory</b>:
We are used to creating objects with <code>new</code>. Sometimes this
is either not available or not the best way. Factories are objects (or
collections of methods) whose sole job is to create other objects. One
example of a factory is the collection of static creation methods on
the Java Box class. 
<li> <b>Builder</b>:
Builders are collections of methods used to build complex data structures
from simpler ones. Builders are useful for data structures with lots
on HAS-A reletionships, espcially when these are not fixed, but rather
data dependent (for example when trying to construct a complex graphical
or 3D model from some stored description).  It is often easier to write
and use a mini-language, in the form of builder methods, capable 
of constructing any structure, than to try to compose things in an ad-hoc
manner.
</ul>
<h3>Interface Patterns</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Adapter</b>:
An adapter pattern makes object type of object follow the interface of
another. It is useful when trying to glue together legacy systems, or
use an existing library in situations where it does not quite match
the rest of the application. An adapter (sometime called wrapper), is
also useful for converting libraries and object in one language (say C)
to another (say Java).
<li> <b>Proxy</b>:
The proxy pattern we saw in connection with distribured objects. Proxies
act as stand-ins for other objects. The support the same interfaces an
the objects they represent, but do not usually implement any of the 
functionality. Instead, the forward methods to another entity (local or remote)
that performs the actual computation.
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Control Patterns</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Finite State Machines (FSMs)</b>:
Finite state machines are a computational paradigm with a great deal of
theory behind them. They are often useful for capturing the state of simple
computations and organizing control flow. Especially in event-driven,
re-entrant, or multi-threaded environments when the state of a computation
must be explicitly stored (rather than implicitly in the call stack and PC).
<p>
Finite state machines can be represented as circles (the states) with
arrows between them the transitions). Typically a transition from state
to state is trigger by some event ( a mouse click, the arrival of a tpye
of packet, etc). FSMs are particularly useful for implementing network
protocols (or any communication protocol), call-flow in telephony 
applications, and hardware controllers. The theory and uses of
FSMs and related models is extensive and worth some study. Many useful
algorithms (such as the string matching in <code>grep</code> depend
on FSMs
<li> <b>Interpreters</b>:
You studied interpreters in the course on scheme. Many times, the natural
structure of a program is the interpretation of some language. In this
case the programmer must construct an interpreter by hand. In doing so
it is important to remember the ideas from programming language interpretation.
<ul>
<li>Environments: A structured way to organize variable binding and resolution.
You studied stack-based environments. Many other schemes are possible.
Binding environments can be implemented simply with hash tables or
some other dictionary structure.
<li>Stack disccipline: Parameter passing, return values, and subroutine
calls. These can all be implemented by hand with auxilliary data structure
if the main language call stack is not available (for whatever reason)
for that purpose. For example, tree search that operated off of a background
timer event and could only proceed a few steps before have to return to the
event loop. A stack structure could be used to emulate the recursive natiure
of the algorithm
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>String Processing</h3>
<ul>
There are two very useful, but non-trivial, string processing paradigms.
Fortunately libraries and tools exist to support both.
<li> <b>Regular Expression Matching</b>:
Regular expressions are a formal language class useful in many applications.
It is a powerful extension of the *-matching that the UNIX command
shell provides. Regular expression packages let you match a string against
an (almost) arbitrary pattern, and bind specific portions of a matching
string to variables. Very useful for text transformations and test
file processing, address, data, and email addres parsing, URL manipulation,
etc. Perl has very strong regular expression facilies. These have
recently been ported into a Java library available on the net.
<li> <b>Parsers</b>:
A parser transforms a string into a tree structure. The particulars
of the transformation are specified by a grammar; a set of rules governing
the expansion of symbols. Parser are useful for complex test processing,
computer language processing (compiling and interpretation), natural language
processing, XML processing. There is a great deal of theory associating
with parsing and writing a good parser is very difficult (as is writing
a good grammar). Fortunately there are many tools, called parser generators,
that will generate a parser given a grammar (which some restrictions).
The UNIX tools YACC (Yes Another Compiler Compiler) and LEX are examples
of these tools.
</ul>
<h3>Arctitectural Patterns:Small Scale</h3>
<ul>
There are some recurrent patterns that are useful ways to organize programs.
<li> <b>Model-View-Controller</b>:
Our old friend. This pattern separates a program into
an underlying data model, code that displays (or stores it),
and code that modifies it. The model often leads to very clear
and well organized programs.
<li> <b>Pipeline</b>:
A pipeline architecture organizes processing into a series of steps,
each performing a transformation on the objects in a stream. The stages
of the pipeline are processing methods, and between the stages there
are FIFO buffers for data (objects) into are out of the stages. These buffers
allow the pipeline stages to operate at (slightly) different speeds.
Often the stages of a pipeline are each operated in a separate thread.
<p>
Although it might not seem like it at first, the pipeline architecture
is perfect for the early stages of network processing. For example,
we can have a pipeline stage that reads bytes out of the network,
assembles them into packets and puts the competed packets on a queue
for further processing. Symmetricly we could have another pipeline
stage (operating in parallel with the first and not sharing buffers)
that read packets off of an output queue and write them to the network.
The rest of the application can then operate using a packet stream
abtraction, reading packet object from input queues and processing them,
and when network output is required, assembling a packet object (a perfect
use for a factory), and placing it on the write queue. The packet
read and write stages are conceptually running in their own threads
(though if writes never block, the main program thread can handle write duty).
This makes for a network interface design that is not only flexible and
elegent, but very straightforward to implement.
</ul>
<h3>Arctitectural Patterns:Large Scale</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Client-Server</b>:
We have seen this before. There is a client process or machine that
(usually) handles the UI and makes requests on a server. The server
contains the application logic and data. (The X-Windows architecture is
a non-intuitive examples of client server. In X, the server is actually
controlling the screen and catching the state of the mouse and keyboard;
the client is the application program which is making requests on the
server for UI functionality. The consequence of this clever though
non-intutive design, is that X programs operate transparently over a network,
whereas programs on most other window systems do not.
<li> <b>3-Tier Architecture</b>:
This architecure is popular today in business and Webb applications.
The client remains the same as in client-server (though perhaps becomes
weaker in the case of Web applications. The server-side is split into
two tiers, a database (or transaction manager) that keeps persistant
data and supports multiple readers and writers, and a middle tier that
implements the logic and control flow of the application.
</ul>
<h3>PostScript</h3>
This is a sampling of the more useful design patterns and programming
paradigms in common use. The best way to learn more is to study theory,
read programs, and write programs. The books on design patterns are of 
some use, but there is no substitute for trying things out.
