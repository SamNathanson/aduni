<h3>Event-based Programming</h3>
<ul>
   <li> Up to now, our control flow model has been pretty straight-forward.
       <ul>
       <li> Execution starts at main() and executes statment sequentially
         branching with if,for,and while statement, and occasional
	 method calls.

       <li> When we need user input we call read() on the console stream
         which waits (blocks) until the user types something, then returns.
       </ul>

   <li> One problem with this model is: How do we wait for and respond to
     input from more than one source (eg keyboard and mouse). If we
     block on either waiting for input, we may miss input from the other.

   <li>Event-based programming addresses the two problems:
       <ul>
       <li> How to wait on multiple input sources (input events)
       <li> How to decide what to do on each type of input event
       </ul>

   <li> Event-based programming is central to modern GUI programming, but
     as a general paradigm is useful to keep in mind in other circumstances.

   <li> There are many implementations of event-based frameworks: Windows C,
     Windows C++, Windows VB, X/Motif, X/GDK, Java

   <li> Basic idea of all of these are the same
       <ul>
      <li> The operating system and window system process input event
       from devices (mouse movement, mouse clicks, key presses etc)
       <li> The window system decides which window, and hence which frame
       and program, each input event beloings to.
      <li> A data structure decribing the event is produced and placed
        on an 'event queue'. An event queue keeps the list of pending events
	(as data structure in the queue). Events are added to one end
	of the queue by the window system (don't worry about how). Events
	are removed from the queue and processed by the program.
	In general, each program has its own event queue, and only
	events relevent to that program's windows are added to its queue.
      <li> These event data structures hold information including:
        <ul>
        <li> Which of the program's windows this event belongs to.
        <li> The type of event (mouse click, key press, etc.)
        <li> Any event-specific data (mouse position, key code, etc.)
	</ul>
      </ul>

</ul>
<h3>Event loop</h3>

The basic structure of event based programs is shown below in
pseudo-code.
<pre>

     main(){

        ...set up application data structures...

        ...set up GUI....

	// enter  event loop
	while(1){
	   Event e = get_event();
	   process_event(e);    // event dispatch routine
        }
   
     }
</pre>
<ul>
<li> Unlike purely sequential applications, after the initial setup and
initialization, this program enters event loop and stays there.
<li> The remainder of program execution is successive execution
     of process_event()
<li> Typically what process_event consists of is a very large switch
statement, or set of if-elseifs, that branches first on the event's window,
then on the event's type, the calls the appropriate handling routine.
(for example, if the event occurs in the main window  and the event is a 
mouse click, it calls the main_window_mouse_click() routine ).
<li> Since all event loops look alike and most event dispatchers (our
process_event() look alike. Many environments hide the event_loop 
and some level of dispatch. All that programmer has to do is supply event 
handlers for the cases of interest.
<li>For examples, in the Windows Win32 C API, the event dispatching the event
loop is hidden and the first level of dispatching (on window) is hidden. 
Hoever, the dispatching on event type is left to the programmer. The way this
works is:
<ul>
<li> The programmer must register an event handling routine (usually
         called win_proc() with each window as it is created.
<li> The win_proc is called from the Windows event_loop (hidden)
         when an event is sent to its window (eg a mouse click happens
	 when the cursor is in its window).
<li> The winproc must determine which type of event it is and respond
         appropriately. Usually winprocs are based around large switch 
	 statements
<li> The winproc branches to code that handles the event
</ul></ul></ul>
<h4>Notes on event handlers</h4>
<ul>
<li> The main programming taks in event-based programming is to write
      handler routines for significant events.
<li> Typically handlers update data structures, modify GUI display, and
      return. Not difficult to program. The chaallange is thinking in
      terms of the basic operations of the application and then in terms
      of the events that trigger them. (Very similar to Web programming).

<li> Event handlers shouldn't block or perform long computation or future
      events will build up in the queue and user responsiveness will suffer.
<li> Since all handler routines end with control returning to the event loop,
      all program state information must be kept explicitly in instance vars
      or data bases.
</ul>
<h3>Java 2 Event Model</h3>
<ul>
<li> Java hides somewhat more of the event mechanism. Basically Java does the
first two levels of event dispatching, source window and event type, 
internally. What the programmer has to supply are handler routines for
each type of event type , source window pair that the program cares
about.
<p>
[Note: Many of these window,event pairs, such as a mouse click on a button,
are handled by pre-packed components with their own handlers. These are
the GUI componenents or <em>widgets</em>. They process local level
events automatically, and can also issue their own higher level events.
We will see more of these next week.]
<li> Java implements what is sometimes called a subscriber model: The program
never needs to know about or deal with events unless it want to provide
a specific handler routine. This saves the programmer from having
to write a lot of code that does nothing but placate the event system.
<li> To understand the Java event system, keep in mind the issue: supplying
handler methods for specific event types from specific source windows.
We will discuss the three players
<ul>
<li> Event type
<li> Specifying Handler methods
<li> source window (where the event came from).
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Events</h4>
<ul>
<li> Events is Java are, of course, objects of class Event. In fact there
is a hierarchy of Event classes depending on the general type of event.
These subclasses include:
<ul>
<il>MouseEvent
<il>MouseMotionEvent
<il>KeyEvent
<il>WindowEvent
<il>ActionEvent
<il>...and several more
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Event Handlers</h4>
<ul>
<li>The goal of our mechanism is to provide handler methods for events.
However in Java, methods cannot exist on their own; they must be members of
a class. The Java window system defines the handler methods it will manage
as a set of interfaces.
<li>Each Event subclass has associated with it an interface
(called the Listener interface) which specifies the handler methods for
that subclass of events. For example we have the interfaces
<ul>
<il>MouseListener
<il>MouseMotionListenr
<il>KeyListener
<il>WindowListener
<il>ActionListener
</ul>
<li>Each of these interfaces species one or more methods to be implemented.
For example: the MouseListener interface has the following methods:
<ul>
<il>mousePressed()
<il>mouseReleased()
<il>mouseEntered()
<il>mouseExited()
<il>mouseClicked()
</ul>
Each of these represents a subtype of mouse event. [You might ask why
some distinctions were considered worthy of a subclass (mouse vs key), 
while others are only distinguished by method (click vs press). This
was simply the engineering judgment of the Java designers.]
<li> The Java window system expects the programmer to create
a class that implements the appropiate interface for any Event subclass
of interest.
<li> Since many Listener interfaces have several routines, Java provides
a convenient set of Adapter classes which implement each Listener
interface with empty methods. So we have MouseAdapter, WindowAdapter, etc.
We can subclass these and only override them methods we care about.
<li> An example of a Mouse event handler that overrides the mousePressed,
and mouseClicked methods (and hence handles mouse clicks and mouse presses).
<pre>
    // Handler for Mouse presses and clicks
    //  Extends MouseAdapator 
    //      (which implements MouseListener with empty methods)

    class MouseHandler extends MouseAdapter{
	
	// call on  mouse button down
	public void mousePressed(MouseEvent ev){
	    int x = ev.getX();
	    int y = ev.getY();
	    System.out.println("Pressed at " + x + "," + y);
	}

	// call on  mouse click (mouse down, mouse up)
	public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent ev){
	    int x = ev.getX();
	    int y = ev.getY();
	    System.out.println("Clicked at " + x + "," + y);
	}

    }
</pre>
<li> The last thing we have to worry about is connecting our handler to
the source window for the events. This is simply done by calling
an addListener method on the window we want to process events on.
The argument to the addListener routines is our handler class that
implements the Listener interface
Actually, there is a separate addListener for each Listener type, so
one would actually use addMouseListener(new MouseHandler())
<li> The addMouseListener should be called on the window that we
want to catch events from. In our example, this is our drawing panel.
We can add the listener in the constructor.
<pre>
class MyPanel extends JPanel{

    // Constructor
   MyPanel(){
       // add Mouse Listener to catch mouse events from MyPanel
       addMouseListener(new MouseHandler());
    }

    public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
	super.paintComponent(g);

	//	    System.out.println("paintComponent");
	g.drawString("Hello World",50,50);

    }

}
</pre>
We could have also instantiated the MyPanel and added the listener
from main() as
<pre>
   MyPanel mypanel = new MyPanel();
   mypanel.addMouseListener(new MouseHandler());

</pre>
<li> Lt's put it together and try it. When combined into our
FrameTest program from yesterday, we should print out the mouse
location (x,y) on mouse presses and clicks. Note that every click of the
mouse generates two events. One for the mouse press (when forms the first
half of the click), one for the click.
</ul>
<h4>Event loops and Java</h4>
<ul>
<li> Now that we have seen how to handle events in Java, let's try to
relate this back to the event loop discussed about. Our main() method
(show below) now matches the structure of the typical event-based program
discussed earlier. In Java, the call to <code>myframe.show()</code> sends
the program into the event loop (which is implemented behind the scenes in
the Java libraries).
<pre>
public class FrameTest{

    // OK let's have our main() create a frame.
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Initialize application

        // Initialize GUI
	MyFrame myframe = new MyFrame();
	MyPanel mypanel = new MyPanel();
	// Random stuff we just have to do (the book explains, kind of)
	Container contentPane = myframe.getContentPane();
	// add panel
	contentPane.add(mypanel);
	// Enter event loop
	myframe.show();
    }
}
</pre>
<li> When we get a mouse press in our frame, the Java window system creates
an event and places it on our programs event queue. The Java event loop, then
removes the event, creates (if it hasn't already) the property MouseEvent
object, find the window associated with this event (our MyPanel), and looks
for any registered MouseListeners. If it finds one (which it does), the
proper method (mousePress, mouseClick,etc) for the event is called with
the MouseEvent object passed as an argument.
<li> This mechanism mow explains how the paintComponent method on
our JPanel get called when the window need updating. The window system
send an update event to the window, which eventually triggers the
paintComponent routine. (There is a little more system magic here that comes
up with the Graphics object for us).

[A detail: Although the myframe.show(); method starts up the event loop,
program execution actually continues after the method call. In this
case it exits the main routine and stops. The event loop in Java
is actually run in a separate thread (we discuss threads later).
As long as the GUI thread is alive, the program keeps running. The
System.exit() of course kills all threads.]
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Handler Programming and Inner Classes</h4>
<ul>
<li> In most cases we want to do something more interesting that
print mouse coordinates on a mouse click. But in order to do more,
we would need to access application data. The question is how? Our
mouseClick method is called from the event loop with only the MouseEvent
object as an argument, so there is no way to send in data. We could have
public static data that the handler could access, but that would be poor
form.
<li> The answer is to make the MouseHandler class an <em>inner class</em>
of MyPanel. The significant feature of inner class instances and methods
is that they have access to the instance variables of the instance
of their containing class. In fact, this is probably the most important
use of inner classes in Java.
<pre>
class MyPanel extends JPanel{

    // Handler for Mouse presses and clicks
    //  Extends MouseAdapator 
    //      (which implements MouseListener with empty methods)
    // We use an inner class so we can access to data on JPanel
    Color current = Color.red;

    class MouseHandler extends MouseAdapter{
	
	// call on  mouse button down
	public void mousePressed(MouseEvent ev){
	    int x = ev.getX();
	    int y = ev.getY();
	    System.out.println("Pressed at " + x + "," + y);
	}

	public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent ev){
	    int x = ev.getX();
	    int y = ev.getY();
	    System.out.println("Clicked at " + x + "," + y);
	    // access instance vars in MyPanel instance that created us.
	    // Can also use keyword 'outer' analogously to 'this' and 'super'
	    //  to refer to enclosing class (in this case an instance of MyPanel)
	    if(current.equals(Color.red))
		current = Color.blue;    // if red switch to blue
	    else
		current = Color.red; // else to red
	    repaint();
	}

    }

    MyPanel(){
	addMouseListener(new MouseHandler());
    }

    public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
	super.paintComponent(g);

	//	    System.out.println("paintComponent");
	g.setColor(current);
	g.drawString("Hello World",50,50);
    }

}
</pre>
<li> In the code about we have made MouseHandler an inner class
of MyPanel so it has access to the <em>instance variables</em> 
of <code>mypanel</code. Inner class instances get access to
the variables of the instance <em>from which they were created</em>.
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Final Word (almost)</h4>
We have covered the basic paradigm of the event-based programming and seen
on overview of how Java implements it in it's WIndow system. While we
have covered the essence, there are many more details about the
Event subclasses and Listener interfaces for Keyboard, WindowEvents,
etc. The book is a good start for more information. After that, the
online doc and experimentation, as always.
<p>
In the next lecture we will talk out GUI components that provide higher-level
functionality, such as buttons, scrollbars, etc. These are windows that
internally process mouse and window events behind the curtains and issue
other types of event to communicate with the larger application.

<h4>PostScript</h4>
<ul>
<li> The general paradigm of designing a control flow by providing
       a set of handlers for events, or requests, or conditions is
       both general and useful. Beyond the event-queue based schemes we
       discussed here, it is applicable to Web programming, where URL
       requests take the place of events. It is also used in AI style
       application known as blackboard or daemon systems. In these systems
       there is a global database of 'facts' or 'propositions'. The handlers
       triiger not off of events, but off of certain conditions on the
       set of propositions. When the database is updated, the system
       checks to see if any of the handler conditions are true. If so
       the handler executes.

<li> Final note: You don;t have to rely on the language or environment
       to support your event queue. If event-based programming is a natural
       fit to your application, you can build your own event queue and 
       event loop.
