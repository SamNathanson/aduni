<h2>Software Development Cycle</h2>
<p>
Although in classes, one often works on individual projects, or in small
autonomous teams on group projects, this is atypical of software development
projects. Product development is an organizational activity (for better or
worse). Usually a project will have several developers and a project manager
who must work together to produce the product. In addition, there are external
influences from marketing, other business and product groups, etc. Even in
open source projects, several developers must cooperate and coordinate to
develop larger systems, and there is usually someone coordinating the efforts
to avoid redundent work and ensure consistency.
<p>
Although it has been going on for decades. Software development and project
management is still an art and a mystery. Some 60% of projects are cancelled
before completion (though it is impossible to tell how many should never
have been started in the first place). This, in part, accounts for the 
popularity of programming methodologies such as OOP, design methodolgies
such as UML, design patterns, etc., and project management tools and systems.
Managers and businesses are always looking for the magic bullet to make
projects work all the time.
<p>
In my humble opinion, the real things you need are: A clear idea of what
you are trying to build and why, and a small team of very good developers.
Unfortunatly, both of these are scarce.
<p>
Stages in project development (and their outputs).
<ul> 
<li> Specification --> Product, module, and interface specs.
<li> Implementation --> Class-level design, code plus documentation.
<li> Testing --> Verify module and product behavior. Produce bug reports.
</ul>
[Note: Design, which might be considered a separate phase, is here split
between specification and implementation. The design processes these phases
is sometimes quite different, or at least performs by different groups.]
<p>
Although there is dependency in these phases. They are often running
simultaneously. Especially once project is implemented, feature requests,
design changes, and bug fixes are happening all continuously.
<p>
Each stage generally includes review processes.
<h3>Specification</h3>
The specification phase usually consist of deciding and documenting
exactly what the product is supposed to do, and usually includes the
high-level architecture of the system in terms of sub-system (modules,
components, etc) and the interfaces between them. This phase typically
solicits input from potential customers, users, marketing, sales, as well as
other parts of the engineering organization.
<p>
The design and architecture aspects of this phase are beyond the scope of
this course. The issues at this stage are the design and specification
of the system architecture and the interfaces between both the sub-system
of the product and between the product and the outside world. 
<p>
What makes this design phase particularly difficult is that
<ul>
<li> The specification must be at a fairly high level to avoid getting
bogged down in implementation details, yet be precise enough so that
there is no ambiguity.
<li> This design must be essentially produced "open-loop". In general, it
is difficult to tell if a design is correct, or at least sufficient, 
without actualy building it. As a consequence, the specification phase
usually has many design reviews, in which the design is presented for criticism
by audiences not involved in its production. Simulations, or partial
implementations can also be used to increase confidence in a system
architecture. In the best of worlds, a mathematical analysis of your
system can be used to point out problems or verify correctness.
<li> Once a specification or interface is published and/or a product is
shipped or put into use, you are stuck with it for a very long time!
Customers will use your product or write systems using your interface
specifications (no matter how lame in retrospect they appear). These users
must be supported and kept happy until they can be pursuaded to ungrade
to a newer, better version. This time span is measure in years is not decades.
</ul>
<p>
Again, the problems of this phase are beyond the scope of this course.
For this reason, in Problem Set 3, we are implementing an architecture
in which most of the design work has been done. There is a published
specification and several reference implementations to compare against.
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
The rest of the course has been above OOP design and programming and how
to implement a given specification. Here we want to discuss the social 
and organizational aspects of program development.
We will only comment
that there is that boundary between the design and implementation phases
depends on the design moethodology, the properties of the team and manager,
and the culture and policies of the larger organization. In some projects,
the design phase is very detailed to the point of specifying every class
and it's methods. Implementation is then a matter of coding. In other
projects, the design is specified at a much higher level, and the detailed
implementation left to developers. In either case, the high level modules
and their interactions and interfaces should be worked out in the design
phase. These can then be distributed among the development team for
implementation.


<p>
Once a project reaches a certain size or includes more than one developer,
a number of new issues arise.
<ul>
<li> With several people developing code, how does each developer get 
up-to-date, yet stable versions of other developers modules.
<li> How do developers cooperate in sharing files, fixed bugs in each others
code, etc.
<li> How is code backed up.
<li> How are self-consistan versions of the code stored over time
<li> How is the over-all system compiled and built from source? Does this
have to happen for multiple platforms.
</ul>
<h4>Source Control</h4>
<p>
These days any non-trivial project uses some sort of source control system
to coordinate multiple developers. There are a variety of popular systems,
some proprietary, some public. Some a real hassle to use, some relatively
painless.
<p>
CVS is a source control system that is relatively popular in both open-source
and commercial projects, probably because it is open-source, free, reliable,
available on many platforms, and relatively painless to use. CVS differs
from some other systems in that developers do not explicitly lock the files
that they are working on (which prevents other developers from changing them).
rather each developer can check out a complete copy of the source tree and
modify any or all of it. (This an important feature; it is very frustrating
to find that the file you need to modify to continue has been locked by someone
who has left for a long weekend.).
<p>
CVS maintains a central repository of source files and keeps a full version
history so that any previous state of the project can be extracted. Developers
interact with the repository through a series of commands (there are both 
command-line and GUI interfaces to CVS, though they implement the same
commands). Amount these commands are:
<ul> 
<li>checkout -- copy the projects source files into a working directory. By 
default the most recent version is downloaded, though there are many options.
<li>update -- incrementally download changes into a checked-out version of the
project. Flags any files with potential conficts with repository versions.
<li>commit -- incrementally upload changed to repository and increment version
number on uploaded files. Asks for a comment describing the changes
to keep in the log.
<li>tag -- names a consistent set of source files.
</ul>
More on CVS can be found at www.cvs.com (???).
<h4>Build process</h4>
Compiling, linking and exprting a project may sound like a trivial task, but
with a multi-person project involving tens to hundreds of files, it becomes
less so. Particularly if multiple versions or multiple target platforms
are required. Often building a project requires specifing many command options
to compilers, linkers, resource compilers, etc. The problem becomes more 
acute when the development group
is not responsible for ongoing builds and maintainance, which is often the 
case. If the project is open course, the build system must be also open
(or at least widely available) and easy to use. Again there are several 
systems to help automate this process.
Most IDE's will provide some sort of build functionality (and many provide
source control). Microsoft's Visual Studio is a capable effort in this area.
The problem with many of these is that they are proprietary and non-portable.
<p>
The javac compiler purports to be a build system, but at present I believe
it is insuffucient for many projects' needs. There is a project at Apache
called ANT which claims to be a build system for Java.
<p>
One popular open build system is Make, developed originally for UNIX but now
widely available, albeit in somewhat incompatable versions. Major properties
of make:
<ul>
<li> It is a rule-based system. One describe the output files to be produced,
the input files each depends on, and the process required to convert input
to output.
<li> The developer enters these rules in a text file, usually called 
<code>Makefile</code>
<li> Make checks all input files for modifications and only preforms those
operations needed to compute the required outputs. In can keep intermediate
files around (compiled modules) to speed incremental builds.
<li> Make's rule system is quite powerful and allows for conditional
compilation, building for multiple targets, and multi-stage processes
to produce output from source. Makefile's often make extensive
use of macros and substitution so can be hard to read.
On the other hand, simple things are generally simple.
<li> To build a system using make, one types
<code>make -f Makefile target</code> where target is the output desired.
If the rules file is indeed called Makefile, the '-f Makefile' can
be omitted.
</ul>
<p>
Sample make file.
<pre>

# Use variable to hold compile flags
JFLAGS = -classpath mypath

# Variable to hold the list of class files we need to produce
CLASSES = Complex.class \
          Polynomial.class \

# main target, causes all files in CLASSES to be made
all: $(CLASSES)

# Rules to produce each Complex.class
# Rules consist of target: dependencies
#                          commands to execute
#
Complex.class: Complex.java
       javac $(JFLAGS) Complex.java    

# General rules to convert .class to .java
%.class:%.java
      javac  $(JFLAGS) @<

# A target to remove non-source files
clean:
   rm *.class
<p>
Another build-related issue is how to organize source and object files.
For a small project, everythings can live is one directory. However, for
a larger project, this becomes cumbersome. There is no general rule for
organizing files, though creating a separate directory for each module
is usually a good idea.
<p>
<h5>Java packages</h5>
Java intermingles class/method namespace issues with  directory organization
(at least for class files). A classes in a package named 'foo' will be be
expected in subdirectory 'foo' relative to the classpath. (This is probably
due to an ill-concevied attempt to impose a Java-centric class oriented
view on users and developers, it ends up being simply annoying until
eliminated with .jar files.) At any rate, this imposes
some constraint on how object files are organized. It is probably a good
idea to keep source files in the same hierarchy.
<p>
<h5>Periodic builds</h5>
In a large on-going project, it is generally a good idea to build the
latest version of system (as it exists in the source repository)
periodically (usually nightly). This is checks that no-one has check in code
that is incompatible with the rest of the system (eg changed an interface).
If the nightly build fails, a search ensues for the guilty party.
<h3>Documentation</h3>
Documentation is an integral part of the software development process. One
can identify several classes of documentation depending on the intended
audience and level of detail.
<ul>
<li>User documentation - This can be either user manuals if the product is
stand-alone software, or API and usage documentation if the product is
a library or component designed to be incorporated into a  larger system.
<li>Installation documentation -- Don't forget this. Need to tell the
end user how to build (if necessary), and install software so it is usable.
<li>Module documentation -- The primary audience for this is developers. This
describes the interfaces (API) and behavior of the major components of the
system. This docuementation is (or should be)  produced as part of the
design process and is both the primary reference on how to use the modules
in question, and the primary specification that the implementers must program
to. All external interfaces fall in this catagory.
<li>Implementation documentation -- This is submodule class and method
documentation. It's target audience is future maintainers of the codebase.
</ul>
<p> In general, user and installation documentation is written by professional
tech-writers (if you are lucky) with input from the designers and developers,
as well as marketing and sales. We will not discuss this further.
<p>
Module level documentation is critical both for successful project completion
(as it specifying design and functionality) and future maintainance. It can
also form the main body of User-level API documentation. It should include,
at minimum, a description of each of the classes and interfaces, 
what they are supposed to represent and do, and descriptions of each of 
their methods. It should be suffient for a developer unfamiliar with the 
project to user the module without examining the source code.
<p>
Implementation documentation is similar to module documentation but at
a lower level. The degree of implementation documentation required is
more flexible. In general, classes and important methods should be documented.
An overview of the implementation should also be provided covering data
representation and any algorithms used. As for in-line documentation, the
code plus comments should be a readable description of what the code is doing;
it should tell it's story (as well as compiling to a working program). If
the code is straightforward and clear, minimal comments are required. If
the implementation is in any way tricky or obscure (eg for optimization),
provide an explanation of what is going on.
<h3>Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Important aspect of project development cycle, should be planning from
design onward.
<li> In large projects, testing will be responsibility of QA engineer or group.
<li> Testing should be multi-level: entire system/program level, module level,
class/implementation level.
<li>Program level: Should test all user-level functionality. Test both
expected and unexpected usages. Technology: Testing GUI-based interfaces
can be difficult. Ideally build some automated test harness to simulate user.
<li> Module level: Test module functionality as defined by module
documentation.
<ul>
<li>Test positive (expected) input for functionality
<li>Test negative (unexpected) inputs for error handling
<li>Test cases on the boundaries (large input, small input, null input).
</ul>
<li>Testing each module individually improves confidence in overall
program correctness.
<li>Module level testing complicated by module interactions and dependecies.
Ideally dependency/calls graph should be a tree. Modules testing can then
be performs bottom-up. Ex:
<pre>
Module 1, 2, and 3 don't depend on (call into) any other modules.
Module 4 calls modules 1 and 2.
Module 5 calls modules 3 and 4.
</pre>
In this case, Modules 1,2,and 3 can be tested independently. Then module 4
tested using modules 1 and 2. Any errors found in testing this combination
 should be confined to module 4 since then others have been already verified
(knock on wood). Similarly 5 can be tested using verified versions of 1,2,3
and 4.
<p>
If the dependency graph includes cycles, testing is more complex. Several
modules may have to be tested as a unit.
<li>Test plan:
<ul>
<li>specify what is to be tested (classes, methods, etc.)
<li>specify the input vectors to be tested and the expected answers
<li>specify how often tests are to be run and how results are to
be evaluated, stored, and tracked.
</ul>
<li>Testing should be an on-going part of project development. As modules
mature, new tests should be added to cover new functionality.
<li>Testing should be incorporated into the nightly build process. Each time
the current system is built. The current test set should be run to ensure
nothing has broken. This allows the status of the system to be tracked
over time. If mysterious behavior is noticed, one can trace backward
through previous version to find when it first appeared.
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Debugging</h3>

I would like to conclude this lecture with some hints on debugging.
<ul>
<li> Develop and test incrementally, the fewer things that change between
tests, the easier it is to find bugs. 
<li> Try to isolate the problem, comment out or disable parts of the code until
the problem disappears, then added it back a one piece at a time until
the bug reappears.
<li> Don't randomly change things. Use science: Form a theory about what
is going wrong. Then think of experiments (changes to code) to perform to
test this theory. It is as important to understand what the bug was as to
fix it. Bugs that mysteriously go away with being understood and explicitly
fixed often return uninvited.
<li> Document fixes to any particularly difficult bug, this keeps future
developers from re-introducing into the code.
</ul>
