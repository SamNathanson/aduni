<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<h3>Lecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: What are interfaces.
  <ul>
  <li>Essentially abstract classes with no instance vars or concrete methods
  </li>
  <li>Cannot be instantiated. Only classes that implement interfaces can
be instantiated. However, variables can be defined to interface types.
  </li>
  <li>Why not just use abstract classes? Java doesn't permit multiple 
inheritance from classes, but permits implementation of multiple interfaces.
  </li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li> Interfaces: General
    <ul>
    <li>A collection of method (of function) with specific signatures and
behavior.
    </li>
    <li>Specifies what a datatype "looks like" to callers: the 'contract'
the between the implementor and caller.
    </li>
    <li>Completely separates specification/behavior from implementation.
    </li>
    <li>Implementation can be in different language or on different machine.
    </li>
    <li>Easy to substitute implementations.
    </li>
    <li>Easy to use multiple implementations.
    </li>
    <li>Useful for implementing callbacks.
    </li>
    <li>Technology of choice for specifying modules (highest level of program
structure) since it abstracts all implementation.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Java Interfaces
  <ul>
  <li>To define: 'interface' keyword instead of 'class', define methods
without implementations.
  </li>
  <li>Interfaces and inherited from parent classes (parent's implementation
is used by default).
  </li>
  <li>Interfaces can be 'extend'ed just like classes: same syntax.
  </li>
  <li>Classes must specify which interface (if any) they implement.
<pre>
class Foo extends Bar 
   implements Interface1, interface2{

   Foo();

   .. code for Interface1 methods

   .. code for Interface2 methods

}

Using interfaces.

Example: Suppose we want to provide a general re-useable method that
returns the maximum element from an array. For positive integer arrays it
would look like

   public int amax(int[] arr){
      int max = 0; 
      for(int i=0;i < arr.length;i++){
         if(arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
      }
      return(max);
   }

Note that the only properties of int's this routine uses is the ability
to compare with '>'. If we can abstract this operation, we can abstract the
method. We could define a class of things that could be compared, but lots
of very different object have order relations, numbers, Strings, points, etc.
Since Java only supports single inheritance, A Comparable type would
mess up a lot of hierarchies. Instead we use an interface.

public interface Comparable{
     int compareTo(Comparable a);  returns -1,0,1 iff this <,=,> a
}

[Java actually defines the Comparable interface, so we don't have to. In fact,
Java defines many useful interfaces and provides many classes that 
both use and/or implement them. Look in the java.util package for many 
examples]

Our general routine now can be written.

   public Comparable amax(Comparable[] arr){
      Comparable max = null; 
      for(int i=0;i < arr.length ;i++){
        if(max == null) || (arr[i].compareTo(max) > 0 )
           max = arr[i];
      }
      return(max);
   }

Interfaces behave in many ways like class types. You can type a variable to an
interface, cast to an interface type, etc. One thing you cannot do is
instantiate an interface. To get an instance, you need an actual class.

Implementing interfaces. Say we want to use our max routine on arrays
of our Complex type which we will order by real part (X coord) then by
imag part (Y value).

   class Complex extends Vect2D implements Comparable{
     .. other stuff

     public int compareTo(Comparable c){
        Complex com = (Complex)c;  // downcast, will cause error if not Complex
        if(getX() <  com.getX()) return(-1);
        if(getX() >  com.getX()) return(1);
        if(getX() ==  com.getX()){
            if(getY() <  com.getY()) return(-1);
            if(getY() >  com.getY()) return(1);
            return(0);   // equals
        }
     }

   }

That's all there is to it. Now we can use Complex in our amax method. And
also in the Java utility classes and methods that require comparable.

<h4>Interfaces vs Classes</h4>

<pre>
Often there is a choice between specifying some functionality as a class,
an abstract class, or an interface. There are no hard and fast
rules for this. Here is some advice:

Java supports only single inheritance, so class hierarchies are strict.
Interfaces are useful for general functionality across a variety of class
types when it would be impossible to represent them in a single hierarchy.

Interfaces are useful for specifying the behavior of high-level modules in
a design as it provides maximum separation of specification and implementation.

Interface can be a nuisance, since one must eventually define classes to
instantiate. You will see this in the Java GUI system.

Class hierarchies should follow 'is-a' relationships. Interfaces follow
'behaves-like-a' relationships.

<h4>Documentation: JavaDoc</h4>
<pre>

Since you are to use it in the problem sets. We will introduce JavaDoc.

Javadoc is a system for helping generate API documentation (of the sort you can
find at java.sun.com). Javadoc help unify the coding and documentation 
processes. Javadoc can document, Classes, Interfaces, instance vars and
methods. [Note: by default it only generates doc of public classes and
interfaces, so be careful in your specification]

To use Javadoc, you write code as usual, but comment your code in a particular
format. The basic Javadoc comment looks like
/**
 * This class sucks.
 */

It is invoked by the /** opening line. The first paragraph after that
is taken as the documentation for the class,interface,method it preceeds;

/**
 * A class implementing complex numbers.
 */
 public class Complex extends Vect2d{
    /**
     * Returns the absolute value.
     *
     * @return Commentary on the return value.
     */
     public double abs(){

     }

 }

Javadoc allows plain text or HTML in comments.

Javadoc also allows a set of special fields indicated in the comment by @

Some examples

@author -- tags the author
@param -- associates following text with a method argument in doc
@return -- associates following text with return value in doc
@see -- references another class or method
