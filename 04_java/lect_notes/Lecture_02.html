Prelude: The Java String data type
    - String is a built-ing data type representing character strings
    - String variable can use standard initialization syntax
           String s = "foo";
    - Java overloads the + operator to cover String concatentation
           "foo" + "bar"  -> "foobar"

    - String variables are reference types
       String a = "foo";
       String b = a;       // a and b are 'eq', reference same object.

    - Unlike integer variables, and like array variables, Strings involve
        two units of memory, the String variable itself, and the storage
	referenced by the string variable (string of characters).

    - Stack vs heap storage

    - String's are an example of a built-in object type.
    - In addition to '+' operator, the string type supports several
       'methods' For example,
           String s = "foo";
	   int len = s.length();  // length method return number of chars (3)

    - We saw static methods in the previous lecture, these are essentially
        global functions in the C or Scheme sense. The length() method of
	String is an 'instance' method. The means it has access to the
	data of a particular instance of the String on with it was invoked.

    - In general method call syntax is   objectvar.methodname(args..);

    - There are also static methods of string. For example:
        String.valueOf(int i) -- returns String representation of i.

    - The general static  method call syntax is  ClassName.methodName(args...)

    - Instance methods are essentially function calls with one implicit 
        argument: the object instance on which the method is called.

    - Strings support other methods
         char charAt(int i)  -- returns character at position i
	 String substr(int start, int len) -- returns substring
    - String's are immutable, once created they cannot be altered (this
        is not true of objects in general.

    - It is important to keep the distinction between the Class String
        and instances of String (ie "foo").

    - String ( and objects in general) are created by calling their
       'constructor' routine with the operator 'new'

           String s = new String("foo");

    - Constructors have the name of the object type (the class). A class
          can have multiple constructors with different argument signatures.

    - Constructors are always called with 'new';

    - Unlike C++, Java has no destructors. Object instances are garbage
       collected when no longer references (as in Scheme).

       {
          String a = new String("foo");  // create new string
	  String b = a;                  // init var with existing string
	  String c = a.concat(b);        // concatentate a and b (same as a+b)
	  int i = c.length();            // i set to 6
	  String d = c.substring(2);     // d set to "ofoo"
	  boolean e = d.equals("ofoo");  // e set to true
       }


Defining Classes

   - String is a built-in object type (this lets Java use '+' for concat)
   - Java (and other OO languages) allows programmers to create user defined
       classes, extending the type system with new object types.

   - Defining new classes is a matter of defining the data each instance
       maintains, and the set of methods that manipulate that data.

   - As a running example, we will develop a class to represent Vect2D
       numbers z=a+bi

   - Classes are defined with keyword 'class'. The source for a class must
       be in a .java file of the same name (case sensitive)

       class Vect2D {

       }

   - The data carried by each class instance is defined as instance variables.

       class Vect2D {
          double x = 0.0;   // x component (initialized to 0)
	  double y = 0.0;   // y component (initialized to 0)
       }

   - Instance vars can be initialized in their definition as well as
       their constructor.

   - Constructor routines have the same name as the class and return no type
      (not even void).


       class Vect2D {
          // Declare instance vars private, only class methods can access
          private double x = 0.0;  // x component (initialized to 0)
	  private double y = 0.0;  // y component (initialized to 0)

	  // Construct Vect2D from x and yinary parts
	  public Vect2D(double xval, double y){
	       x = xval;  // instance vars are in scope in class methods
	       this.y = y;
          }

       }

   - The implicit instance argument is bound to the reserved variable 'this'
        We could have used this.x instead of x.

   - Since data members are private (always good practice), we provide
        accessor routines to access them. There is a naming convention:
	for variable 'foo' accessor is getFoo()

       class Vect2D {
          // Declare instance vars private, only class methods can access
          private double x = 0.0;   
	  private double y = 0.0;   

	  ... Constructors etc....

	  // Accessors
	  public double getX(){
	     return(x);
          }

	  public double getY(){
	     return(y);
          }

       }

   - We are making Vect2D an immutable type, otherwise we would
      supply mutator methods as well (convention setFoo())

   - Vect2D should support an absolute value methods (sqrt r2 + i2)
   
       class Vect2D {
          // Declare instance vars private, only class methods can access
          private double x = 0.0;  
	  private double y = 0.0;  

	  ... Constructors, Accessors etc....

	  // absolute value routine.
	  public double length(){
	     return(Math.sqrt((x*x) + (y*y)));
          }

       }

     
   - Vect2D should support an binary operations add and mult. We have
       a choice: make them static binary methods as in

         public static Vect2D add(Vect2D a, Vect2D b);

       or unary instance methods
	
         public Vect2D add(Vect2D b);    // first argument implicit

      Binary (static form emphesizes symmetry while unary (instance) form
        more flexible due to inheritance. We'll do both here.


       class Vect2D {
          // Declare instance vars private, only class methods can access
          private double x = 0.0;   // x part (initialized to 0)
	  private double y = 0.0;   // yinary part

	  ... Constructors, Accessors etc....

	  // Multiplication by a real (scaling)
	  public Vect2D scale(double s){
	    Vect2D result = new Vect2D();  // empty constructor
	    // Class methods can access instance var of ALL instances
	    //  (assuming it has references in scope).
	    result.x = (x * s);
	    result.y = (y * s); 
	    return(result);
          }

	  // Addition
	  public Vect2D add(Vect2D b){
	    Vect2D result = new Vect2D();  // empty constructor
	    // Class methods can access instance var of ALL instances
	    //  (assuming it has references in scope).
	    result.x = x + b.x; 
	    result.y = this.y + b.y; // to be explicit
	    return(result);
          }

	  // Addition
	  public static Vect2D add(Vect2D a, Vect2D b){
	    Vect2D result = new Vect2D();  // empty constructor
	    // Class methods can access instance var of ALL instances
	    //  (assuming it has references in scope).
	    result.x = a.x + b.x; // to be explicit
	    result.y = a.y + b.y; // to be explicit
	    return(result);
          }

       }

    - As in above, methods can be overloaded with different argument signatures

Design with classes: Typical class types

   - As we can see, developing classes and programming methods is pretty
      straightforward. The challanging part is deciding which classes
      to create and what methods to support.

   - Some common catagories of classes in typical programs

   Database -- classes that essentially represent database objects, common
                  in business ( or psuedo-business apps). Ex
		  Employee, Manager, Order, RushOrder, InventoryItem, ...
		  Many programs are consist essentially of DB manipulation,
		    always ask 'why not use a real DB?'

   Algebraic -- classes represent algebraic types (eg Complex)
   Container -- classes to hold collections of objects: lists, hashtables, etc.
   I/O and Network -- mediate access to external data streams.
   GUI objects -- Buttons, frames, text areas, etc.
   Graphics -- Fonts, images, brushes, etc.
   Callbacks -- a technical use of objects to pass methods around as arguments
                 and store as data (methods are not first-class objects in
		 Java, they need a supporting instance).

   public,private,protected keywords for methods,variables
   static, final keywords

   new in expr        (new String("foo")).length
   return value as expr   foo(b).bar(c);

   mutators
   implications of lack of destructor (resource cleanup).
