<h2>Internationalization and Localisation</h2>
The is lecture is about Internationalization and Localisation, which
are usually abbreviated I18N and L10N (count the letters) in the
profession.
<p>
The motivation behind i18m and l10n is that not everyone in the world
is an English-speaking American. And while this fact adds interest to life
for the traveler and writer, it is a nuisance for programmers. Up until
now we have been writing our programs for an american audiences. Some things
that we would have to worry about to generalize our programs for an 
international audience are.
<ul>
<li> Formats 
<ul> 
<li> Numbers 12,345.00 vs 12.234,00
<li> Currency symbols
<li> Dates 1/21/2001 vs 21/1/2001
<li> Sorting (alphabetizing)
</ul>
<li> Character sets: Not all languages use roman characters
<li> Language: All strings (messages, button labels, etc)
presented to the user must be in the desired language. This means a
copy of each string in each language!
</ul>
<h3>Languages and Locales</h3>
To localize an application (instantiate a particular set of formats,
characters,and messages) we need to know the language/locale pair we
are targetting. Locale specifies place whereas language specifies,
well, language. There are ISO standards (ISO 639 and ISO 3166)
 which represent languages and locals as two character codes for 
example, American English is en.US, British English is en.UK.
<h3>Character Sets and Encodings</h3>
Character sets and encodings are related but different concepts. A character
set is a list of characters required for a language. An encoding is a mapping
of characters into binary values. There are, unfortunately, a variety
of character sets and encodings in use, some overlapping. Some of
the more important are described below:
<ul>
<li> <bf>ASCII</bf>
Most early computer work was done in English and the first character
sets were mappings of the standard English typewriter characters. ASCII
is a standard encoding of this character set. ASCII characters are encoded
as 7-bit values; numbers from 0 to 127. This is because at one time,
users interacted with computers via character terminals or teletypes
connected to the processor by serial lines. These serial lines were noisy
and occasionally corrupted bits. Therefore, each character was sent as 8-bit
bytes, but only the lower seven were used to ancode the character. The
upper bit was always set to make the number of 1's in the byte always
even (or odd, depending on the convention). Thus an error in any one bit could
be detected as any one bit error would produce a byte with an odd
number of ones. (The error could not be corrected, but the character could be
retransmitted).
<li> <bf>ANSI, Latin-1, ISO 8859-1</bf>
As hardware technology progressed, the upper bit was no longer needed for 
parity checking and could be used for encoding. Several 8-bit character
encoding arose in the 70's and 80's. Eventually one was blessed by standards
organizations. This encoding is called Latin-1 or ISO 8859-1. This encoding
is ASCII compatable as the first 128 encodings are exactly ASCII. The higher
characters cover most Western European languages.
<li> <bf>ISO 8859-X</bf>
There are a number of other ISO 8859 encodings which append to the basic
ASCII set, additional characters for other languages. These are ISO 8859-2
through 15 or so and cover ASCII plus Eastern European languages, Cyrillic,
Arabic, Hebrew, Modern Greek, etc.
<li> <bf>Unicode and UCS-2 (ISO-10646)</bf>
Eventually you get to languages with character sets that don't fit in
8-bits, or one wnats to represent several languages simultaneously.
Unicode is a character set that covers most alphabetic languages and
most of the important characters in Chinese and Japanese. UCS-2 is a
16-but encoding for this character set. The first 128 characters of
Unicode are the ASCII characters. But in UCS-2 they are represented
as two byte units with the upper byte always 0. This means using
UCS-2 causes text data to swell by a factor of two in size if only
ASNI characters are being represented.
<p>
A great advantage of both ASCII, 8859, and UCS-2 is that the characters
are all the same size, 8 or 16 bits, so indexing into a string is
easy. One problem with Unicode and UCS-2 is that it does not cover
all Chinese characters, of which there and more than 64K.
<li> <bf>UTF-8</bf>
To both extend the encoding range and keep down the size of text, the
UTF standards were developed. UTF-8 encodes characters using a variable
number of bits. Again the first 128 characters correspond to ASCII and
here they are represented in their original 8-bit form. Bytes with a high
order bit of 1 represent the beginning of longer characters which are
represented by more than 1 byte. This encoding scheme is good in that
ACSII data take no extra space and can be read with no extra overhead 
in computation (full backward compatability). On the other hand, it is
now more difficult to index into a string as a character can start at
any point. The string must be parsed from the beginning.
<li> <bf>Others</bf>
There are several other encodings, Some like UCS-4 and UTF-16 are designed
to represent even more characters. Some like BIG5 are alternate encodings
that developed pre-standard and persist (BIG5 is a Chinese character encoding
poopular in Taiwan).
</ul>
One of the concerns around character encodings is to determine the format
a text file (or XML) document is in so it can be translated into the
native encoding of a programming language (UCS-2 Unicode in the case of Java).
The format of files can either be guessed from the default format of
the system (US Linix and Windows default to Latin-1). Alternatively
the file tagged externally (for example in the HTTP header information
for a file to be downloaded). Alternatively, the file could be self describing,
with the first bytes of the file devoted to the encoding type.
<h3>Support in Java</h3>
Java has a number of facilities for l10n. As we saw in the stream IO
lecture, The Java Reader and Writer classes attempt to deal
with the character encoding issue and save the programmer much hassle
on IO (at the price of more hassle for procesing ASCII).
<p>
Java has a Locale class which contains a number of locale specific
utilities. To get a Locale for a given language/country pair, use
the constructor.
<pre>
Locale loc = new Locale("da","DK"); // get the locale for Danish/Denmark
</pre>
This Locale object can be passed to factory methods on the
Java NumberFormat and DataFormat classes to return NumberFormat
and DateFormat objects targetted to the given local for numbers,
currencies, dates, etc.
<pre>
// get localized currency formatter
NumberFormat form = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(loc);
</pre>
The Format classes have parse() and format() methods which will
parse and print currency amounts in the local format.
<h3>String localization</h3>
The support for String localization is a little more primitive. 
For each String in the UI you must assign a key or index, then produce
all of the language variants for that string. Now we need a way to
organize all of these strings and automatically load the correct set.
<p>
To do this, one must put all the strings for each language into a class
that inherits from ResourceBundle. These classes should have methods that
return the desired string given the key (ie a lookup method). These
classes must be named according to the following scheme
<code>MyResourceClass_language_country</code>. Now we have all of the strings
(and images and whatever other resources need to be localized) for each
language in a class, we just need to load the right one for the locale.
Java has a support method to do just this.
<pre>
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResourceClass",loc);
</pre>
where loc is our Locale var. This method will look for classes of the form
<code>MyResourceClass_language_country</code>, then
<code>MyResourceClass_language</code>, then
<code>MyResourceClass</code>. In other words, it tries to load the most 
specific resource bundle class it can find for that locale. Once the
class is loaded, the lookup methods can be used to retrieve Strings based
on their keys.
