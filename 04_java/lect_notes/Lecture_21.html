<h2>Summary</h2>
This course has covered a lot of material, from the basic principles
and concepts of OOP, though the application of these principles in
common programming situations:
<ul>
<li>IO programming
<li>event-based programming
<li>GUI programming
<li>exception handling
<li>mutli-threaded programming
</ul>
<p>
Aside from this survey of programming technology, the main take-home lessons
of this course should be the motivations, principles, and mechanisms
of OOP:
<h4>Motivations</h4>
What are we really trying to achieve with OOP
<ul>
<li>Maintainability
<li>Extensability
<li>Reliability
<li>Clarity
<li>Efficiency (both programmer and program)
</ul>
<h4>Principles</h4>
What ideas are we using to acheive these goals
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation -separating implementation from use
<li>Abstraction - code re-use, avoid duplication, implement algorithms
at a high level using abstract types.
</ul>
<h4>Mechanisms</h4>
What entities in Java support these concepts
<ul>
<li>Classes and access control 
<li>Strong typing 
<li>Inheritance and polymorphism 
<li>Interfaces
</ul>
<h3>Process tips</h3>
We have also discussed the process of software design and development and
will leave you with these tips.
<ul>
<li>Think first, code second
<li>Design, specify, and document top down
<li>Implement and test bottom up
<li>Functionality and Clarity first - optimize last (if ever).
</ul>
