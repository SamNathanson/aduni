<h2>Component Object Models</h2>
Binary components, also known as component objects or controls, represent
the leading edge of software technology. This area contains a number of
good ideas and much promise. However, it also abounds with hype, promotion,
and competition. In this lecture we will try to cover the basic ideas
and introduce the player and the technologies without getting too much into
details.

<h3>Components</h3>
<ul>
<li> We have often used the term component to refer to GUI elements such
as buttons (which we have also called widgets). The term component in this
lecture refers to a different, more general, but as we will see related notion.
<li> The motivation behind components (binary components, component objects,
the terms are mostly interchangable) is to take the concepts of software
re-usability, abstraction, and encapsulation to the next level. Components
are OOP on steroids.
<li> We have seen these concepts implemented in Java in the form of classes
and interfaces. However, these are treated very traditionally from a 
programming point of view, they are all compiled together in the same language
(Java) and the compiler has access to all of the application's class files 
when compiling any class. These classes are all linked together are loaded
into a single process to run.
<li> Components are analagous to classes, but they
<ul>
<li> Are not necessarily written in the same language as the application.
<li> Are dynamicly and extensively configurable by the application as runtime.
<li> Expose their behavior to the application only as an abstract interface.
<li> Support introspection so the application can deduce the interface
at runtime, rather than compile time
<li> Do not necessarily live in the same process, or on the same machine
as an application that uses them.
</ul>
<li> One goal of component technology is to create re-useable modules
(ie components) with complex behavior which can be easily controlled
by scripting or integrated into a larger application.
<li> Another goal is to allow the component to be written is a different
language from the application that uses it. This allows complex functionality
to be optimized inside components in a language like C, yet allows the
components to be used from high-level, easy-to-use languages like VB or Perl.
<li> A third is to separate the component from the calling application so
the need not be in the same process, or on the same machine.
<li> The main players in the component game (and their technologies) are:
<ul>
<li> Microsoft (OLE, COM/DCOM, COM+, ActiveX, MTS)
<li> Java (JavaBeans, RMI, EJB)
<li> OMG (CORBA, IIOP)
</ul>
<li> Component technology, although really a common set of ideas, splits into
two sub-area depending on which of the goals above is most important.
These two areas can be thought of as:
<ul>
<li> Scriptable components, including GUI components, mainly used
in client applications (although also useful on Web servers).
<li> Distributed components, main used in multi-tier enterprise applications.
</ul>
Microsoft and Java have entries in both of these areas, while CORBA/IIOP
is mainly targetted to enterprise applications.
</ul>
<h3>Scriptable Components</h3>
<ul>
<li> This model works best for components with functions that are
useful in many applications, but difficult to re-implement. Some examples
are
<ul>
<li> GUI components in general, especially the more complex ones:
chart display, HTML display.
<li> Gui elements which also encapsulate an application: Spread sheets,
XML editor, etc.
<li> Signal processing components: MP3 encoders, decoders, image encoders,
decoders, speech synthsizers, speech recognizers.
<li> Misc processer: XML parsers, compression, encryption, etc.
</ul>
<li> Each of the items listed above have the property that they encapsulate
functionality which is difficult to build, but conceptually easy to use once
built. For example, the algorithms behind speech synthesis are difficult to 
implement, but the interface for using a speech synthsis program is simple:
You give it a text string, it produces a waveform.
<li> There are, of course, stand-alone programs that have the functionalities
described above. But it is often useful to be able to embed and use these 
functionalities in the context of a larger application, without the
hassle of implementing them from scratch.
<li> This is the promise of scriptable components, that one can download
or by pre-compiled configurable modules that can be easily incorporated
into programs written in a variety of languages (after all, if the hard work
is done is the components, our language to glue them together can be very
high-level). This model changes application building from the tedious
low-level programming of basic functionality, configuring pre-built
components, connecting them to GUI controls, and scripting them to work
together. 
<li> Microsoft promoted these ideas early on with their OLE and ActiveX
technologies. OLE was disigned to allow the active embedding of
components into documents; for example a spreadsheet into a text document.
ActiveX was targetted originally toward GUI components.
<li> These components could be written in C/C++, yet scripted in VB and
manipulated with graphical design tools. Using these components and
graphical design tools, a programmer can put together a GUI layout and
connect the necessary GUI events into the objects the are to control.
<li>Java's entry into the scriptable components area, it's answer to ActiveX,
is called JavaBeans.
<li> Unlike other vendors, Java's components not language independent. They
are meant to be written in Java and scripted in Java (though perhaps with
graphical design tools support). This does make the construction of
Java components easier, even if they are not portable.
<li> In fact, JavaBeans are just classes. They do not even have to inherit
from some master class like servlets or applets. However, they do have
to follow a strict set of naming conventions for their methods, or
supply an auxilliary BeanInfo class object that describes them. These
naming conventions (or the BeanInfo) allow graphical builder tools or
scripted application to use the components without knowing their complete
behavior ahead of time. They allow the properties (instance vars) 
of the JavaBean and their types to be deduced from their interfaces.
This allows them to be edited and configured on the fly, essentially
have the program itself do some of the progamming.
<li> The book contains somewhat more information about JavaBeans, but their
are several books on JavaBeans alone, and interest has grown as their use
has moved beyond the GUI sphere to include Web-server applications.
JavaBeans are an important part of JSP-based Web app development.

</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Distributed Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The second application of component object technology is distributed
componenents in enterprise applications. The vision behind this is
to have the diverse collections of databases and information systems,
running on a variety of hardware architectures, all work together as
(more or less) one large Object-Oriented Program. This is an ambitous
vision, and it must be said the current software technology
is far from achieving it in a straightforward, maintainable and reliable
way. 
<li> What we will discuss is a small part of the overall problem, namely,
how to create and use an object (ie a class instance) is an application if
the actual instance is in antoher process, or on another machine on the 
network, running on a different operating system
and written in a different language.
<li> To get a handle on this, we need to consider what the application
need to know and have to access a local class.
<ul>
<li> The interface: It needs to know what methods are available to call
<li> Constructor: It needs a way to construct an instance of a class.
<li> Reference: It needs to have a reference to a class instance to
assign to variables, and call methods on.
<li> Argument passing and return: It needs a way to pass arguments into 
the method and get a return value.
<li> A method (procedure) call mechanism: A way to actually make a method
call and wait for the return. Normally this pushes a new frame on the
call stack and jumps to the method code.
</ul>
<li> Now let's look at how to implement these in a distributed
environment. Consider the situation where we have the application running
in a process on some client machine, and the object class we want to use
exists in a process on a server machine.
<li>The idea is to use a design pattern know as Proxy. We create a object
(a class and instances) in the client process that behaves to the application
like a local instantiation of the object it wants to use. It does not
actually implement any of the actual object's functionality, it is merely a 
facade that gives the application the impression it is talking to a
local instance. 
<li>The proxy (also called the Stub) supports instance creation 
(eg <code>new</code>) and can return to the application a reference to
an object. This reference is not to the ACTUAL object that the application
wants to use, but to a local version of something the BEHAVES like
the actual object, in other words, has the same interface.
<li> The proxy will somehow, talk to the remote machine and mediate between
the application and the remote object.
<li> In order for the proxy to work, we need a way to specify the interface
that the object supports and the application expects. In Java, this could
be simply an <code>interface</code> definition. However, if we want to
support distributed objects written an different languages, we need a
way to define interfaces that is language independent.
<li> These languages are called IDL's (Interface Definition Languages). Each
distributed component scheme (Java, CORBA, COM/DCOM) has it's own version,
although the all look more or less like Java interfaces. The main difference
is that IDL's must use a set of datatypes (int, float, string, etc) that
are defined independent of any specific language (fortunately most languages
suppport more or less the same set of basic types).
<li> An interface, written in IDL defines the behavior of the object as
it appears to any application.
<li> Matching the proxy on the server side, there must be something that
looks to the object like the calling application, and communicates over the
network to the client process. This is sometimes called the skeleton.
It does not actually contain the application's logic and code, it is merely
something to make a standard method call on the object.
<li> Now we have our client application calling methods on the proxy, and
the skeleton calling methods on the object. All we have to do
now is get the proxy and skeleton to communicate. Essentially, we need some
sort of inter-process, intermachine calling mechanism. The various
object technologies have their own version of this.
<ul>
<li> In CORBA, this is mediated by ORB's (Object Request Brokers) that
manage the interprocess procedure calls. Intermachine procedure calls are 
implemented by the ORBs on each machine communicating through IIOP
(Internet InterORB Protocol).
<li> In Java, this is mediated by Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
mechanism.
<li> In Microsoft systems, DCOM is the native mechanism.
<li> These systems interoperate to a certain extent, for
example, there is RMI over IIOP.
</ul>
<li> What these RMI-like mechanisms all have to do is, <em>marshall</em>
the arguments to be passed (convert them from the calling languages format
to a neutral network format), send the arguments, an identifier for the
remote instance to be accessed, and the name or ID of the methods to be called.
The far end of the network connection, finds the instance to be called,
converts the arguments to local formats, and the skeleton then calls the
desired method on the specified instance. When the method returns, the
reverse of this interaction occurs to pass back any return values over
the network to the callers.
<li> The beauty of the scheme, which really shows the power of interfaces,
it that the application thinks it is talking to a local object and the 
server object thinks it is being called by a local application.
<li> Of course in practice there are a lot more issues.
<ul>
<li>
How does the client machine find a server machine that supports the 
desired object.
<li> What happens if either machine or the network crashes during the
operation.
<li> How does one do sharing and synchronization.
</ul>
<li> Finally, remote objects are only one part of the problem of distributed
enterprise applications. Another set of issues are how to
implement persistence (data that remains stable beyond any
execution of the application), and transactions (sequences of operations
that have a number of important properies such as atomicity and consistency).
This will be our topic for Monday.
