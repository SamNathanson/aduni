<h2>GUI Components (Widgets)</h2>
In the previous lecture, we discussed handling events from the mouse (and
by analogy the keyboard, window manager, etc). Modern user interfaces abound
with complex display and functional units. Although it is possible to build
an entire GUI from scratch handling only the basic events, it is not only
tedious and time comsuming. To save programmers from this chore, most GUI
environments provide a set of pre-built library components that implement
commonly used UI functionality. These GUI components (often called widgets)
process the basic mouse and keyboard events in their windows and communicate
with the rest of the program through a set of method calls (API)
and by sending their own events (which are processed through the event queue
just like the basic mouse and keyboard events).
<p>
There is another benefit to these widget sets besides saving the  programmer
some work. Programs using a particular Widget set will all tend to have
similar "look-and-feel"-s and behave similarly. This is a great benefit to the
user who can count on things to look the same and act the same between
programs. 
<p>
There are really no new paradigms or technologies involved in using 
widgets. They are created and added using the same methods we used for JPanels
when discussing graphics. The event handling follows that used for the mouse
events. The additional complexities introduced by GUI components are really
to their variety, functionality, and sheer number per program. In particular,
the issues are:
<ul>
<li> How to instantiate components and link them into the window hierarchy.
<li> How to handle events from the components, and determine which component
an event came from, without the program becoming unmanageable. (There is
only one mouse and one keyboard, but there can be tens of buttons in a
single application).
<li> How to transfer data into and out of components. We addressed this
problem a bit when discussing mouse handlers. It gets more difficult
as the amount and complexity of component data increases.
<li> How to organize and present the components on the screen (layout)
</ul>
<p>
Much of the effort of GUI programming is combing the books and 
on-line documentation.
There are around 20 component types in Java, we will only give a small
sampling in this lecture, chosen to illustrate the basic points above.
We are also going to postpone a discussion of layout for another time.
<p>
We are also going to ignore the whole issue of what makes a good GUI design.
This is far beyond the scope of this course and is a field in itself ( there
are many books on this subject, along with several journals and conferences).

<h3>
Basic Components: Buttons
</h3>
<ul>
<li> Buttons are one of the simplest components and generalizes the
mouse application we wrote in last lecture.
<li> The basic button class is JButton. It creates a clickable rectangular
area labeled with either a text string or an icon(image). The label is
passed into the constructor.
<li> Buttons can be added to Panels or Frames. (the choice is determined
by layout concerns which we will deal with later). Let's rename FrameTest
to WidgetTest and add our button. We are adding to the drawing panel for
simplicity. 
<pre>
	JButton toggle = new JButton("Toggle");
	// Random stuff we just have to do (the book explains, kind of)
	Container contentPane = myframe.getContentPane();
	// add panel
	contentPane.add(mypanel);
	// add button to panel
	mypanel.add(toggle);
</pre>
<li> We now have an application with a button. However, in order to get 
it to do something we need to add an event listener. The event class
trigger by buttons (and many widgets) is <code>ActionEvent</code>, the
handling method is the <code>actionPerformed</code>, method of the
<code>ActionListener</code> interface. So we make our listener class:
<pre>
class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener{
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
	System.out.println("Toggle pressed");
    }

}
</pre>
and add it to our button
<pre>
	toggle.addActionListener(new ButtonHandler());
	mypanel.add(toggle);
</pre>
<li> Cool, but as we found with the mouse handler, in order to be useful,
the handler must somehow have access to program data. As in the mouse case
we will address this by making the handler an inner class of MyPanel and
moving the instantiation of the button into the MyPanel constructor.
(The book, in chapter 8, has an example of how you can use
anonymous inner classes to avoid names all of your listener classes.
We will skip this "optimization").
And for our content, we will swipe the color toggling code from lecture 9.
<pre>
    // Now an inner class so we can access data.
    class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener{
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
	    if(current.equals(Color.red))
		current = Color.blue;
	    else
		current = Color.red;
	    repaint();
	}
	
    }

    MyPanel(){
	JButton toggle = new JButton("Toggle");
	// add listener
	toggle.addActionListener(new ButtonHandler());
	// add button
	add(toggle);
    }
</pre>
We now have the same application as in lecture 9, but the toggling only
occurs when the mouse clicks in the button.
<li>
We could add another button to the panel to turn the color green, by
creating a new button and listener class. However, we can also try to
reuse our listener for both buttons. (Doing one vs. the other is purely a 
design decision to be based on which makes for code that is easiest to
understand and modify).
<p> The actionPerformed method, if shared, needs to be able to tell which
button was pressed. It can do that based on information on the ActionEvent.
It can get a string associated with the event through 
<code>getActionCommand()</code> or the source object (the button) through
<code>getSource()</code>. The ActionCommand string for buttons defaults to
the label string.
<p>
To use the getSource method, we have to have the button variables in scope
to compare against. So we will now make them instance variables on
myclass (rather than local to the constructor).
<li> There are several varieties of buttons and button collections in Java,
CheckBoxes, RadioBoxes, ComboBoxes. They all work similarly. Refer to
the book and doc for more.
</ul>
<h4>Text Input</h4>
<ul>
<li> Let's now add a different type of widget. One that is used to input
a single text field. Creating and adding this component is familar, we use
the same approach as for buttons, only we pass in the size and default
string into the constructor.
<li> Text components, like all Swing components, use the Model-View-Controller
pattern in their internal implementation. In the can of text components,
the Model is based on a Document interface (standard Document-type interfaces
are prevalent these days, there are several associated with the various
XML standards. This one, however, is specific to Java). We could use
the underlying model to get events that change the underlying document
(rather than tracking every keystroke). The book explains this in detail.
<li> We are going to be less ambitious here and only respond to text input
when the user hits return in the test box. This causes the text input
widget to send an Action event. We are going to again reuse our
Action listener (which may or may not be good style!).
<li> The TextField component has getText and setText methods to access
the model data.
<pre>
    Color current = Color.red;
    String msg = "Hello World";

    // button variables now instace vars.
    //  May as well init here.
    JButton toggle = new JButton("Toggle");
    JButton green = new JButton("Green");
    JTextField text = new JTextField(10);


    // Button listener. Now an inner class so we
    //  can access mypanel data.
    class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener{
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
	    // check source, if green button, set color
	    if(e.getSource() == green){
		current = Color.green;
	    }
	    else if(e.getSource() == text){
		String s = text.getText();
		if(s != null) msg = s; // install as new msg
		repaint();
	    }
	    else{ // do toggle stuff
		if(current.equals(Color.red))
		    current = Color.blue;
		else
		    current = Color.red;
	    }
	    repaint();
	}
	
    }

    MyPanel(){
	// add listeners
	ButtonHandler b = new ButtonHandler();
	toggle.addActionListener(b);
	green.addActionListener(b);
	text.addActionListener(b);
	// add buttons (and text field)
	add(toggle);
	add(green);
	add(text);
    }

</pre>
<li> Although we won't discuss them here, check to book to learn how
to use Sliders (easy) and JTextArea. Also check out using the latter
with JScrollPane to and scrolling with no work.
</ul>
<h4>Menus</h4>
<ul>
<li>Menus are actually buttons from a functional point of view, they
are just initialized and displayed differently.
<li>We need to first make a menu bar, then add menus, than add items 
to the menu and provide listeners to the items. The listeners we need are
again ActionListeners. We could reuse our ButtonListener, except that
the branching is on buttons, not our menu items. For now we will duplicate
and modify.
<pre>
class MyPanel extends JPanel{

    // Color and string are now instance vars so we can change them
    Color current = Color.red;
    String msg = "Hello World";

    // button variables now instace vars.
    //  May as well init here.
    JTextField text = new JTextField(10);
    // Menu items created by menu.add(), still need to keep them for handler
    JMenuItem toggle;
    JMenuItem green;

    // We are using button Listener verbatim. Only difference
    //  is that we changed our buttons above to JMenuItems
    class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener{
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
	    // check source, if green button, set color
	    if(e.getSource() == green){
		current = Color.green;
	    }
	    else if(e.getSource() == text){
		String s = text.getText();
		if(s != null) msg = s; // install as new msg
		repaint();
	    }
	    else{ // do toggle stuff
		if(current.equals(Color.red))
		    current = Color.blue;
		else
		    current = Color.red;
	    }
	    repaint();
	}
	
    }

    // Need myframe so we can add menubar 
    //  (could do in main and pass in menubar instead)
    MyPanel(JFrame myframe){
	// Need to add menu stuff and add to frame (not panel)
	JMenuBar mb = new JMenuBar();
	myframe.setJMenuBar(mb);
	// create menu and add to menuber
	JMenu cmenu = new JMenu("Colors");
	// Note: book is in error here, calls non-existant addMenu()
	mb.add(cmenu);
	// add() method on menu creates and adds menu items
	toggle = cmenu.add("Toggle");
	// add a horiz line to look cool
	cmenu.addSeparator();
	green = cmenu.add("Green");
	// make one instance of listener and add to all
	//  works exactly the same as for buttons
	ButtonHandler b = new ButtonHandler();
	toggle.addActionListener(b);
	green.addActionListener(b);
	text.addActionListener(b);

	// add text field
	add(text);
    }

    public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
	super.paintComponent(g);

	//	    System.out.println("paintComponent");
	g.setColor(current);
	g.drawString(msg,50,100);
    }

}
</pre>
<li> Say we wanted to share our handler between the menu items AND buttons.
The book shows how to do this in Chapter 9. There is an interface called
Action which extends ActionListener with stuff to deal with labels and icons.
By implementing Action instead of action listener and parameterize the
constructor with a name one can share the code. Both JButton and JMenuItem
have constructors that accepts an Action arg which is used to set
both the label and the listener.
</ul>
<h4>Dialog boxes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Dialog boxes give the program the ability to pop up new frames to
request context specific user input. This simplifies the UI since
only those commands available all the time must be shown in the default
UI.
<li>Dialogs come in two varieties model and modeless. Modal dialogs
bloc the application from continuing until they close. Modeless dialogs
run in parallel with the application.
<li> Java provides a number od methods on JOptionPane that will popup
simple modal dialog boxes (for example, warning msg boxes that remain until
the user click on OK).
<li> Creating a more elaborate dialog is also fairly easy.
<ul>
<li> Create a new frame, but instead of extending JFrame, extend JDialog.
<li> Constructor must call super(Frame parent,String name,boolean modal).
<li> Keep instance variables for the data the dialog is supposed to set.
<li> Add panels and components to the contentPane of the JDialog
<li> Add listeners for the components.
<li> Traditionally an OK button is used to return. 
<li> All actions that can close the dialog window (windowClose, OK button etc)
must call hide(), dispose(), or setVisible(false) to return from dialog
properly.
<li> In main app, we want to show the dialog create a new instance of
the class. [Note: The book claims you can create a single instance and
re-use it. I have not gotten this to work. Although it works fime the first
time, it does not seem to pop up again!!]
<li> To popup dialog call the show() method on the dialog instance.
<li> Show() will block until dialog returns (by calling hide9), dispose(),
or setVisible(false) ).
<li> When dialog returns, use accessors or utility methods to access dialog
data set by user. Traditionally, user input from dialogs is ignored unless
the OK button has been clicked. Any other return (ie Cancel, windowClose)
usually ignored the new data.
<li> The example here uses accessors to get dialog data. The book uses
a different technique. Study them both and use what's convenient. There
are lots of ways to peel a radish.
</ul>
<li>Following is new code for DialogTest to pop up dialog and get data
<pre>
    // new ButtonHandler that calls dialog from menu item rather
    //   than toggling color directly
    class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener{
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
	    // check source, if green button, set color
	    if(e.getSource() == ditem){
		// We do not seem to be able to create and re-use a
		//  dialog the way the book does! Must create new every time???
		MyDialog dialog = new MyDialog(null);
		dialog.show(); // popup dialog
		// get data out
		current = dialog.getCurrent();
	    }
	    else if(e.getSource() == text){
		String s = text.getText();
		if(s != null) msg = s; // install as new msg
	    }

	    repaint();
	}
	
    }
</pre>
<li>Following is complete code from MyDialog
<pre>
public class MyDialog extends JDialog{

    // must make instance var since we need it to access panel data.
    DialogPanel dialogPanel;

    public MyDialog(JFrame parent){
	// must call JDialog constructor, 
	//  final arg true makes show() blocking.
	super(parent,"Color Dialog",true);
	setSize(200,200);        // size in pixels
	// new default close action -- DISPOSE rather then EXIT
	setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);
	// Add panel
	dialogPanel= new DialogPanel(this);
	getContentPane().add(dialogPanel);
    }

    public Color getCurrent(){
	// just forward request
	return(dialogPanel.getCurrent());
    }

}

// DialogPanel hold buttons. Class has listener as inner class
class DialogPanel extends JPanel{
    // the dialog that contains me, needed to call isVisible(false)
    JDialog dialog;

    // This color is not used to draw, it is just the 'model' that
    //  this dialog alters. This data is retrieved by the main app
    //  through the getCurrent9) method
    Color current = Color.black;

    // Handler for Mouse presses and clicks
    //  Extends MouseAdapator 
    //      (which implements MouseListener with empty methods)
    // We use an inner class so we can access to data on JPanel

    JButton toggle = new JButton("Toggle");
    JButton green = new JButton("Green");
    JButton ok = new JButton("OK");


    // Button listener. Now an inner class so we
    //  can access mypanel data.
    class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener{
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
	    // check source, if green button, set color
	    if(e.getSource() == green){
		current = Color.green;
	    }
	    else if(e.getSource() == toggle){ // do toggle stuff
		if(current.equals(Color.red))
		    current = Color.blue;
		else
		    current = Color.red;
	    }
	    else{ // OK
		// setVisible(false) close dialog and causes show() to return!
		dialog.hide();
	    }
	}
	
    }

    DialogPanel(JDialog dialog){
	// make one instance of listener and add to all
	this.dialog = dialog;
	ButtonHandler b = new ButtonHandler();
	toggle.addActionListener(b);
	green.addActionListener(b);
	ok.addActionListener(b);
	// add buttons (and text field)
	add(toggle);
	add(green);
	add(ok);
    }

    public Color getCurrent(){
	return(current);
    }

}
</pre>
<li> Java supplies built-in dialog types for choosing Filenames (including
a directory browser feature) and colors. The book and doc describe their
use.
</ul>
<h4>Table Widget</h4>
Finally, we will end with a most complex widget that with a more complex model.
<ul>
<li> The table widget represents data in columns and row, like a spreadsheet.
<li> The model for the table widget can be any class that implements
the TableModel interface (natch'). There is, as usual, a convenience class
that implements most of the methods called AbstractTableModel. We only
need to implement
<ul>
<li>public int getRowCount();
<li> public int getColumnCount();
<li>  public Object getValueAt(int row, int column);
</ul>
though String getColumnName() is also useful. Note that this model
allows entirely dynamic computation of the table cell contents (much
as the paintComponent() method allows dynamic computation of graphics.
<li> Cells can be made editable by having the isCellEditable(r,c) method
return true for those cells.
<li> The Widget updates the model when edits are done by calling showValueAt().
<li> It is possible to select cells by cell, row, column, or region. The
book explains how to deal with selections. Curiously there does not
seem to be an event indicates cell selection. (though perhaps there
is and I just haven't found it.)
<li> Below is code for a simple table of numbers. The second column
is editable. Note also use of JScrollPane to get scrolling.
<pre>
class MyFrame extends JFrame{

    public MyFrame(){
	// set up UI
	setTitle("MyFrame");
	setSize(200,200);        // size in pixels
	setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
	// make model
	MyTableModel model = new MyTableModel(31);
	// make table
	JTable table = new JTable(model);
	// Random stuff we just have to do (the book explains, kind of)
	Container contentPane = getContentPane();
	// add panel with scroller
	JScrollPane scroll = new JScrollPane(table);
	contentPane.add(scroll);

    }

}

class MyTableModel extends AbstractTableModel{
    int rows = 2;
    int cols = 2;
    String[] colnames = {"Day","Hours"};
    Integer[] hours;
    MyTableModel(int rows){
	this.rows = rows;
	hours = new Integer[rows];
	for(int i=0;i<rows;i++){
	    hours[i] = new Integer((int)(Math.random() * 8.0));
	}
    }
    
    public int getColumnCount(){
	return(cols);
    }
    public String getColumnName(int c){
	return(colnames[c]);
    }
    public int getRowCount(){
	return(rows);
    }
    public Object getValueAt(int r, int c){
	if(c == 0) return(new Integer(r));
	else return(hours[r]);
    }
    public void setValueAt(Object value, int r, int c){
	hours[r] = new Integer((String)value);
    }
    // make second column editable
    public boolean isCellEditable(int r, int c){
	if(c > 0) return(true);
	return(false);
    }
}

public class TableTest{

    // OK let's have our main() create a frame.
    public static void main(String[] args){
	MyFrame myframe = new MyFrame();
	myframe.show();
    }
}
</pre>
</ul>
<h4>Postscript</h4>
There are many other interesting widgets including spinners, progress bars,
toolbars, tree widgets, tab widget (one of my fav's), and HTML/RTF text
widgets. Explore and have fun.
