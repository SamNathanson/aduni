<h2>Java on the Web</h2>
<h3>Java in the Browser: Applets</h3>
<ul>
<li> Early in the development of Java, the ability to run Java programs
(called applets) inside browsers was hyped as both the future of Java and the
future of the Web. It is probably fair to say at this point, neither is true.
<li> The main benefits of Applets were the added power of Java vs HTML, and
the ability to create a better, more interactive UI than was currently
available from HTML. To a great extent, these issues have been solved
by a combination of client-side scripting (JavaScript and VB), and 
binary extensions (plug-ins and ActiveX controls). It is a rarity to find
a site that depends of Java applets to run.
<li> In fact, even if you create an applet using Java 1.2 and Swing to
develop a great UI, you are unlike to find a browser that can run it.
Netscape 4 and IE only support Java 1.0, Netscape 6 allows the user to
specify a Java virtual machine to run, while later version of IE are
dropping Java compatability. Sun supplies a Java plug-in for IE and Netscape
that enables Java 1.2 applets, but getting a substantial population of
user to download this and install it is difficult. (I don't plan to
install it).
<li> On the other hand, building an applet is easy. Instead of containing
your application in a JFrame, you extend <code>JApplet</code>. Eliminate
the main() and frame specific code (the sizing, 
the default close, the call to show()).
<li> The <code>JApplet</code> class have four methods you can override
<ul>
<li>init() -- This is where to put one-time init code. This method is called
when an applet is loaded into the browser for the first time.
<li>start() -- This where to put the non-init part of main(). This method is
 called each time the user returns to a page containing your applet.
<li>stop() -- This is called each time the user leaves a page containing your
applet
<li>destroy() -- called when the browser shuts down
</ul>
Converting an application to an applet is simply rearranging the top-level
startup and shutdown into these four methods. They can call into the rest
of your classes as usual.
<li> One other difference between an applet and application is the
number fo things you cannot do. In general you can't access files, execute
programs, or open net connections to machines other than the applet's home.
<li> Now that you have an applet class file on your web server, you must embed
it in a Web page so it will be downloaded and displayed by users. Here again,
time has passed Applets by
<li> In early versions of HTML embedding an applet was straightforward using
the APPLET tag
<pre>
&lt;APPLET CODE=MyApplet.class" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=300 &gt;
</pre>
<li> However, in HTML4.0 the APPLET tag has been deprecated. One must use 
either the OBJECT tag or the EMBED tag. The OBJECT tag is a syntactic 
nightmare with 35 attribute and is best handled with automatic HTML generating
tools.
<li> Again incompatability abounds, even if you write Java 1.2 applets and
expect your user population to download the Java plugin, the HTML to
include an applet in a Web page different substantially between Netscape
and IE
<li> If you like hopeless endeavors, you can try to convert your SameJava 
game into an applet, this should be pretty straightforward. Following the
book you can generate HTML code to embed it in a Web page (depending on the
brrowser version of the client). However, the chances that many will
go through the trouble of assembling the client-side technology neccesary to
run you applet are slim.
</ul>
<h3>Very Brief Intro to Web Programming</h3>
Though client-side Java, in the form of applets, is a dying technology,
server-side Java is alive and vibrant. Some of the most interesting
applications of Java are in Web server tools and technology, and much of the
XML work on the Web is being done first in Java.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The underlying protocol used by the Web is HTTP. In this protocol,
the client (browser) establishes a socket connection to the Web server, sends
a request for a page, downloads the response on the socket, then closes
the socket connection.
<li> Although, the downloaded response could be any type of data, we will 
assume it is text/HTML.
<li> The job of the server, then, is to listen for connections, receive
requests for download (in the form of a pathname), and send back an HTML
page.
<li> The simplest case for the server is if the URL corresponds to a static
HTML page. This is just a text file on the servers filesystem containing
HTML, which is simply opened and downloaded to the client.
<li> As Web sites became more ambitious, they wanted to do more than
serve static pages. For example a site than returns the current time,
or current price of a stock, must do some computation and perhaps some
database access.
<li> The original mechanism to do server-side computation was CGI. Web
servers would map some portion of the server's path space  (usually
all paths starting with /cgi-bin/) to programs or scripts rather than
files.
<li>Under CGI, the Web server would fork a new process to run the program or
script, which would perform the necessary computation
and then write HTML on its standard output stream 
(equiv to System.out in Java). THe Web server would re-direct this output stream to the client. So the HTML page the client receives is never stored on the
server but dynamicly computed by the CGI script.
<li> The CGI method was successfull but slow, the process of forking off
new processes for each request was expesive. Furthermore, it made sharing
resources between CGI processes (for example database connections) difficult.
<p>
To address these issues, Web server developed the ability to run certain
sorts of programs and scripts 'in-process' by multithreading the Web server.
Now each script runs in its own thread but can share things like database
connections (which are expensive to set up).
<li> Different Web server support different programming/scripting languages 
in-process. AOLserver (which AD uses) supports Tcl and C APIs, Apache
can support a variety using plugin modules, though Perl is commonly used,
MS IIS supports VB.
<li> Not to be left out, Java developed a system for running Java programs
'in-process' to handle Web requests. In fact there are two related
technologies, servlets and JSP. The main difference between them
is the authoring model. Using servlets, the author writes a
Java program that emits HTML (usually though a series of calls to println()).
Using JSP, the author writes in HTML with the ability to call Java methods
through special tags, which are evaluated on the server <em>before</em>
the page is sent to the Web browser.
<p>
Since Java programs, unlike C, requires a Java runtime, most Web servers
do not run servlets directly. The are a few Web server, like Apache Tomcat
which specialize in server-side Java (at the expense of standard Web page
performance). Often a dual strategy is adopted, one server for Java pages
and one for static and traditional CGI.
</ul>
<h3>Servlets</h3>
<ul>
<li> Servlets are Java programs meant to be invoked by a Web server (and
associated server container) in reponse to a Web request. The servlet performs
arbitrary computation  and eventually write HTML to an output stream.
<li> A Servlet enabled Web servers map a portion of their web space to
correspond to servlet applications. These are invoked through paths
with the particular servlet class as the last element in the path.
<li> Servlets, like other Java programs are classes. In particular, 
all servlets must extend the class Servlet. For HTTP requests, which is what
we are interested in, there is a subclass HttpServlet which has added
utilities for dealing with HTTP requests.
<li> HttpServlet has only a few methods to overwrite, the most important are
<code>init</code> and <code>service</code>.
<li> The <code>init()</code> method is call once, the first time the servlet
is loaded into the Web server. It should be used for one-time initialization.
<li> The <code>service()</code> method is called once for each HTTP request.
<li> A sample "Hello ADU" servlet is shown below.
<pre>
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;


public class ServTest extends HttpServlet {

    public void service(HttpServletRequest request, 
			HttpServletResponse response)
			throws IOException, ServletException{
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
	out.println("&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;");
	out.println("&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello ADU servlet&lt;/h1&gt;");
	out.println("&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;");
    }
}
</pre>
<li> The two arguments to the service() methods are an HttpServletRequest
object (just another class), and a HttpServletResponse object. The Request
object represents the user's request and contains header information (such
as what-type of browser the user is at) plus any query arguments (from
HTML forms, for example).
<li> The Response object is the connection back to the client. This object
have a PrintWriter on which the servlet should write it's HTML.
<li> The servlet above is very basic, it simply gets the PrintWriter from
the response object and writes a trivial HTML file. Note that even
in this trivial example we are getting a lot of println()'s. Imagine
if we were writing a page with hundreds of lines of HTML!
<li> Servlets can call other classes and generally operate as any other Java
program. It can access files on the server and does not have the restrictions
that an applet does.
<li> <b>Threading</b>: One important point to remember is that ALL incoming
requests share the same servlet! In order words, all servlet code is implicitly
and massively multithreaded. As a consequence of this, instance variables on
a servlet are of limited use and should generally be read-only as they
are shared by all threads. Of course one could always synchronize the service()
method or some utility methods, however, this has the effect of serializing
all requests into the server and will slow down performance significantly.
<li> <b>Sessions</b>: As Web sites become more complex, the <em>state-free</em>
nature of the HTTP protocol becomes a limitation. Remember, a basic HTTP
transaction is open a connection, send request, get data, close connection.
Once the connection is closed, both sides can forget about each other. This
is a problem when building any sort of e-commerce site which has multi-turn
interactions, the user browses, addes things to the shopping cart, and
finally pays. If the server forgot the contents of the cart after every
turn, it would be a disaster.
<p>This problem is addressed at the protocol level by remembering some
information associated with the current Web session which can be used to
tag session information on the server. There are two ways to keep this
information, the first is to build it into the Web pages sent down and
the URLs sent back. This is known as URL-rewriting. The second method
uses cookies, small files stored on the client's machine to identify the
current user and session. The details of the session management protocol
are irrelevent here. Only the fact that it is possible is important.
<li> Once we are able to identify a user and session, we still need to
access all of the data for that particular session. In many systems, a database
is used to track session data between requests. However, Java provides
a convenient mechanism in the servlet packages: the <code>Session</code>
object.
<li> As part of the request handling process, the servlet mechanism will 
retrieve a session object for a request. This is either the current session
associated with this user, or a new session. The session object supports
the ability to add and retrieve data by keyword (as in a Hashtable).
The session object is not shared between thread (as only one thread at 
a time is processing requests from any given client), and is the preferred
place to put program data meant to be user/session specific.
<li> The code below shown a simple servlet that maintains a counter
holding the number of times each user has called it. Each user will get their
own count which will be independently updated. (Actually, this only counts
recent visits to the page as sessions typically time out after 1/2 hour.
<pre>
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;


public class ServTest extends HttpServlet {

    public void service(HttpServletRequest request, 
			HttpServletResponse response)
			throws IOException, ServletException{
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
	HttpSession session = request.getSession();
	Integer count = (Integer)session.getAttribute("count");
	if(count == null)
	    count = new Integer(0);
	session.setAttribute("count",new Integer(count.intValue() + 1));
	out.println("&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;");
	out.println("&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello ADU servlet&lt;/h1&gt;");
	out.println("count = " + count);
	out.println("&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;");
    }
}
</pre>
</ul>
<h3>JSP</h3>
<ul>
<li> Note that even in out small examples, a lot of our servlet is 
println()'s generating HTML. This would be similar in any 'in-process'
Tcl or Perl program as well. This is not the most elegant way to author
HTML.
<li> As Web technology progressed, an alternately mechanism arose. Instead
of a server-side program which generated HTML with println() statements,
one writes an HTML page with special tags that invoke server-side
processing. (Note this is different from the special tags that contain
JavaScript and invoke client-side processing).
<p>
Probably the first example of this technology was Microsoft's Active Server
Pages (ASP). Other examples are Allaire's ColdFusion and PHP (the open source
favorite. Java's entry into this are is called JSP, JavaServer Pages.
<li>JSP pages (forgive th redundency) are standard HTML with special
tags that invoke Java functionality. The most straightforward of these
are tags that simple lines of Java code. These server-side script tags
can perform computation and generate HTML which is inserted into the
larger HTML document in place of the script tag. 
<li> JSP and Servlets are intimately related. In fact JSP pages are actually
converted into servlets as they are loaded.
<li> Below is a sample JSP page to print the date
<pre>

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;JSP Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello ADU&lt;/h1&gt;
It's &lt;%= new java.util.Date().toString() %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>

<li> Since they are effectively servlets. JSP pages have access to the
Request,Response, and Session objects.
<li> There are about 20 different tag types in JSP pages beyond invoking
basic Java code. Many of these deal with accessing <em>JavaBeans</em>, which
are (one of) Java's implementation of <em>components</em>. Indeed, much
of JSP seems to be designed to push the use of JavaBeans.
Other tags deal with connecting the Web server-side application to
a database using JDBC. Another topic for another day.
<li> The purported advantage of the server-scripting/component combination
(JSP and JavaBeans in the case of Java), is that is promotes the
separation of the programming logic (done in Java and encapsulated in
components), and the presentation, done in HTML.
However, JSP, JavaBeans, and related server-side techologies represent 
the cutting edge of programming technology today. As such they are 
surrounded by both intense vendor competition and tremendous hype. It remains
to be seen whether they are the wave of the future or will go the way of
applets.
