<H2><B>Lab Assignment</B> - Pipelining the BETA!</H2>


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size=+1>This lab is hard, and you will have
to <i>think</i> in order to complete it! We really
mean it! Start early and work hard.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Introduction:  What's up with the ugly picture?</FONT></B></P>

<P><b><font color=ff0000>In this lab we're going to write the control logic for the pipelined
BETA.</font> We'll produce a BETA that is dramatically faster than our original
implementation, but we'll pay for that speed with extra logic and complexity.</b></P>

<img src="pset_05_html_files/lab5small.gif" border=3 align=right width="354" height="343">

<p>If you're feeling really macho, go ahead and load up the lab in Betasim, and
knock yourself out programming the ROMs.  Once you've looked at the datapath
and come to your senses, come back here for the full explanation of what's going
on.</p>

<p>On the right is a shrunk-down version of the entire datapath.  The red lines
mark the stages of the pipeline.  You'll notice that each red line goes through a
bunch of registers.  Those registers mark the boundaries of the stage.  If you look
closely, you might be able to spot some familiar items from Lab 2.  Unfortunately,
pipelining the BETA requires the addition of a whole lot of extra circuitry.<p>

<p>Below, we'll go over each of the stages in detail, one at a time.<p>

<p>The other thing you might notice about the datapath is that there are a <i>lot</i>
of control ROMs lying around.  Why did we break up the control into a bunch of ROMs,
instead of just having one big rom?</p>

<p>There are almost 40 bits of input information that we need in the control ROM to
handle all of the logic.  If we were to make a real ROM table out of this, the table
would need 2<sup>40</sup> lines of information.  That's about 1 trillion lines.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, there is a ton of redundancy in that table.  We can take just a few
input bits to produce an intermediate value in one ROM.  Another ROM can take that
intermediate value and a few more input bits to compute some more values, and
so on.  In the BETA datapath at right, there are seven ROMs, none of which take more
than 12 bits of input (4096 lines).  Ah, abstraction!</p>

<br clear=all>

<h2><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif">The stages</font></h2>

<p>Each of the pictures below starts with one set of registers, shows the logic of one
stage, and ends with another set of registers.  The names of the
<font color=e00000>control ROMs</font> have been highlighted in
<font color=e00000>red</font>, the <font color=008000>switches</font> are
indicated in <font color=008000>green</font>, and the <font color=6000d0>input
bits</font> to the control ROMs are shown in <font color=6000d0>purple</font>.</p>

<h3>Stage 0: Instruction Fetch</h3>

<p>This stage reads the instruction from the instruction memory, and does as much
interpretation of the instruction as it can -- we want as much information as we can
get as soon as possible.</p>

<p>At the very top is the <b>pcsel</b> mux.  This mux selects the source of the new PC:
PC+1+constant for a branch, a register for a jump, some trap address for a trap,
or PC+1.  You folks were all over this problem in Lab2, so we've already coded up
the <b>pcselrom</b> shown here to pick the correct <b>pcsel</b> for you.  Aren't we nice?</p>

<p>There are a bunch of things we can tell from the instruction word without looking
at anything else.  These are listed in the table on the right.</p>

<p>The register and switches on the far left are something new.  The <b>pcen</b> switch
enables the pc register, and also is the data input to the first register.  Thus the
output of the register, <b>s0en</b>, records whether we latched something in the
instruction fetch stage.  In other words, when <b>s0en</b> is true, there is an instruction
being processed in this stage.  This technique appears in every stage.  Making this work
is your first assignment in part 1 of this lab.</p>
<br clear=all>

<h3>Stage 1: Register File</h3>

This stage looks up the values for Ra and Rb (and possibly Rc) in the register file, and
prepares the inputs for the ALU stage.

<p>There is a bit more going on in this stage than you're probably used to.  The 
<b>asel</b> and <b>bsel</b> muxes, which should be familiar, are each preceeded by a
bypass mux.  You will use these muxes in part 4 of the lab.  Don't worry about them
until then.</p>

<p>There also appears to be an extra adder in the middle of this stage.  It's adding the
constant to the PC+1, and feeding the result back to the pcsel mux in Stage 0.  This line
gets used during a BRZ or BRNZ instruction.  As part of the lab checkout, you'll have to
answer the following questions about this adder:
<ul>
<li> The adder is missing in the unpipelined BETA.  Where was the functionality in the
unpipelined beta to add the PC+1 to the constant?
<li> Why didn't we just leave well enough alone?  In other words, what benefit can we
get by adding this extra hardware?
<li> If it's so good having this adder in the Register Fetch stage, why didn't we put it
in the Instruction Fetch stage?  (There are two reasons for this -- you'll need both for
the checkout.)
</ul>
Some of the answers may not be obvious right away, but should become clearer as you
do the lab.

<h3>Stage 2: ALU</h3>

<p>This stage is pretty boring.  In fact, the <b>alurom</b> is something you did back in
Lab 2, so we've written it for you.  (All right!)</p>

<p>The two XOR gates on the far right are used in detecting hazards (which you'll worry
about in Part 2 of the lab). <b>rfa2</b> is true when the destination register being
computed in this stage matches the Ra being looked up in the Register File stage.
<b>rfb2</b> tests for the similar case on Rb.</p>
<br clear=all>

<h3>Stage 3: Memory / Write back</h3>

<p>This stage performs memory reads (LD / LDR) and also performs memory and register
file writes.  Also included in this stage is the special I/O gizmo box we hid from you
on Lab 2.  The gizmo box acts just like a memory, but it is selected <i>instead of</i>
the memory when the address is a small negative number (when bit 30 of the address is set --
see an explanation of why we chose bit 30, if you're
interested).</p>

<p>It may look at first glance like this stage doesn't have a set of registers at its end.
Think again!  The registers are actually the write ports of the memory and the register
file.  In fact, we've called the ROM for this stage <b>s3clken</b> which seems really
cryptic, until you realize that its main purpose is to enable the write clock on the
appropriate destination box in this stage.</p>

<p>Once again, you've done all of this stuff in Lab 2, so we've filled in <b>s3clken</b>
for you.  (Phew!)

<h3>Part 1 -- The Pipelined BETA, one instruction at a time.</h3>

<p>Part 1 is just for practice:  you only need to edit one ROM, and the resulting
pipeline isn't all that smart, but it will help you understand a bit better what's
going on.</p>

<p>To make the pipelined BETA work (really stupidly), we'll force the pipeline to stall
until each instruction has made it individually through the entire pipeline.  You should
be gasping in disgust right now, but trust us on this, you don't want to go straight to
Part 2.</p>

<p>Log into Betasim with lab 5 selected (it should be the default if you use this page
to log in).  Before you do anything else, choose "Save as" from the file menu and rename
the path file "Lab5p1.path".</p>

</table>


<p>To make this thing work, you'll need to edit the <b>stageen</b> ROM.  Double-click
on the <b>stageen</b> ROM to open the ROM edit window.  You'll need to write expressions
for the following switches:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>pcen</b></dt>
<dd>Enables the PC register, and starts a new instruction flowing through the pipe.</dd>
<!--holdbit==0 && (s0en || s1en || s2en)==0-->
<dt><b>stage1en</b></dt>
<dd>Enables the Stage 1 (Register file) registers</dd>
<dt><b>stage2en</b></dt>
<dd>Enables the Stage 2 (ALU) registers</dd>
<dt><b>stage3en</b></dt>
<dd>Enables the Stage 3 (Mem/WB) registers</dd>
<dt><b>go</b></dt>
<dd>Enables the registers that keep track of which instruction is in which stage.
Leave this as 1 for now.  You'll use this in Part 2.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>The expression for <b>pcen</b> should be pretty straightforward.  You don't want to
enable the PC until the current instruction has made it to the Mem/WB stage.  You
should use the <b>s0en</b>, <b>s1en</b> and <b>s2en</b> inputs to enforce this.</p>

<p>When should the Stage 1 registers be enabled (<b>stage1en</b>)? They should be
enabled when there is some data ready to be latched, of course.  Look at the schematic
and figure it out... it's pretty easy.  <b>stage2en</b> and <b>stage3en</b> are frightfully
similar.</p>

<p>If you've followed the directions exactly, you might notice that your processor now
executes programs correctly, but doesn't seem to want to halt.  Fix your <b>pcen</b> 
definition to account for halting.</p>

<p><font size=-1><b>TIP:</b></font> Sometimes, it's easier to work in negative logic.
Instead of writing an expression for <b>pcen</b>, it might be easier to write an expression
for something like <b>pcdisable</b>, and then write <tt>pcen= (pcdisable==0)</tt> (There
is no unary ! operator in Betasim.)  Go ahead and do it.  The Betasim ROM parser regards
any name that doesn't match a switch name as a local variable.</p>

<p>When you're done, SAVE YOUR WORK!</p>

<p>The default code runs the fractal code from Lab 1 at a depth of 4.  You can double-click
the gizmo box (next to the memory in the Mem/WB stage) to open the terminal window and
watch the BETA draw the fractal.  In the control panel (under the "Clock" menu), hit the
reset button twice.  Click the grey words "Click here to enter an expression", type "clock",
and hit return.  The value is the number of clock ticks that have elapsed since you hit
the reset button.  Hit "Go" and "go fast".  When the program halts, write down the number
of clock ticks elapsed (you may have to click the value to change it from hexidecimal to
decimal).  This is your benchmark number.

<h3>Part 2 -- Naive pipelining</h3>

<p><font color=600000>This is the tricky part.  Think carefully, and be patient while
you are debugging.</font></p>

<p>Before you start this section, load your work from Part 1, choose "Save As..." from the
"File" menu, and save the path as "Lab5p2.path".</p>

<p>In Part 1, you created a working pipelined BETA, but a pretty stupid one.  It was as if
you were doing your laundry, and waited until you took your first batch of clothes out
of the dryer before you put your second batch into the washing machine.</p>

<p>We'd like to be able to start the execution of a second instruction while the first one
is still in the pipeline.  We can do this, but there are some dangerous situations we have
to be careful about.</p>

<p>The first problem is pipeline hazards.  If Instruction B attempts to use the result of
a previous Instruction A <i>before</i> Instruction A has written its result
into the register file, then Instruction B will execute with the wrong value for its argument.
We need to be able to <i>hold</i> an instruction at the Register File stage while
instructions later in the pipe continue to execute.</p>

<p>The first step is to figure out when we need to hold the pipe.  Double click the
<b>holdrom</b> ROM, and write a new expression for <b>hold</b>.  You should only
need to use <b>s2en</b>, <b>s3en</b>, <b>rfa2</b>, <b>rfb2</b>, <b>rfa3</b>
and <b>rfb3</b>.  Think carefully about what each of these mean.</p>
<br clear=all>

<p>Now we need to rewrite <b>stageen</b>.  <b>pcen</b> at this point should be ridiculously
easy.  Don't worry.  It'll get more complicated in a few paragraphs.</p>

<p>What does it really mean to hold the pipe?  "<i>We need to be able to hold an
instruction at the Register File stage while instructions later in the pipe continue
to execute.</i>"  What does this involve?</p>

<p>Obviously, we can't update the PC.  We've taken care of that with <b>pcen</b>.  But
if there's an instruction in the RF stage (Stage 1), we can't let it go on to Stage 2 until
the hold is released.  Therefore, we can't enable the registers for Stage 2.  But we can't
let go of the instruction waiting in Stage 1, so we can't enable the Stage 1 registers
either.  Think about this carefully, and then rewrite the expressions for <b>stage1en</b>
and <b>stage2en</b>.</p>

<p>If you run the simulator now, you'll get a nasty hold-related bug that's really tough
to track down.  The reason is the following: we've just disabled the registers for Stage 1
by setting <b>stage1en</b> to 0.  But we still need to remember that there's an
instruction waiting in Stage 1 (indicated by <b>s1en</b>).  But if we let the register
that holds <b>s1en</b> clock, we'll lose that knowledge.  Look carefully at what <b>go</b>
does, and write the expression for <b>go</b>.</p>

<p>Okay, here's where <b>pcen</b> gets complicated.  There is one more kind of hazard
that can give you problems: Jumps and Branches.  If we have fetched a JMP instruction
(indicated by <b>jmpop</b>), or a BRZ or BRNZ instruction (indicated by <b>jumpfetch</b>),
then we can't know where the next instruction is coming from until the JMP, BRZ, or
BRNZ instruction makes it into the Register File stage (Stage 1).  Think <i>very hard</i>
(this is tricky), and rewrite <b>pcen</b> to account for branches and jumps.</p>

<p>SAVE YOUR WORK!</p>

<p>If everything checks out, run the fractal code again, and record the number of clock ticks.
Nice, no?</p>

<h3>Part 3 -- Smarter scheduling</h3>

<p>If you were watching the pipeline carefully in Part 2, you may have noticed that it was
being stupid about some pipeline conflicts.  In particular, register 31 is always zero, so
there can't be a hazard that depends on r31.</p>

<p>Double click the <b>rfbits</b> ROM.  You'll be rewriting the expressions for <b>useA</b> and
<b>useB</b>.  <b>useA</b> should be true only when the value coming out of the A side of the
register file is being used in the computation.  Obviously, the A side is only in use when
<b>ais31</b>==0 (Ra is not 31).  The A side is in use when <b>asel</b> is 1 (selecting Ra instead
of PC+1)... but it is also in use in other cases.  Figure out what they are and rewrite <b>useA</b>.
Similarly, the B side is in use when <b>bsel</b> is 0 (Rb instead of the constant), but there are
other cases... Rewrite <b>useB</b>.</p>

<p>Note that the <b>useA</b> and <b>useB</b> switches go directly into the <b>aselbit</b> and
<b>bselbit</b> bits.  The <b>holdrom</b> can use these bits to be more careful about when
to <b>hold</b> the pipeline.  Rewrite <b>hold</b> in the <b>holdrom</b>.

<P>Now we'll implement our super-performance feature, bypassing. While
this isn't all that complicated, it's generally costly in terms of area
(think of all the wires), so bypassing didn't arrive untill second generation
RISCs.</P>

<p>By this point, you're all experts at this stuff, so we aren't going to give you any help on
writing <b>bypassA</b> and <b>bypassB</b> in the <b>bypass</b> ROM.  Just think hard, and
be careful.</p>

<p>Once you've written <b>bypassA</b> and <b>bypassB</b>, you can take advantage of the
bypassing to make your <b>useA</b> and <b>useB</b> bits even smarter.  Rewrite <b>useA</b>
and <b>useB</b> in the <b>rfbits</b> ROM to include the new information from <b>abypassed</b>
and <b>bbypassed</b>.

<p>SAVE YOUR WORK!</p>

<p>Run the fractal code yet again.  If you turn off the "go fast" option, you can actually see
how often the bypassing wires are in use (they turn red when the bypassing is used).  Record
the number of clock ticks, and prepare to be amazed.</p>

<h3>Part 5 -- Assessing the gain</h3>

<P>So how good is this pipelining idea? Let's examine some real numbers.
&nbsp;We have four stages: IF, RF, ALU and MEM/WB. </P>

<P>We have the following times for each pipeline stage:</P>

<UL>
<LI>IF -- 4ns</LI>

<LI>RF -- 4ns</LI>

<LI>ALU -- 2ns</LI>

<LI>MEM/WB -- 5ns</LI>
</UL>

<P>Assuming the added delay of the pipeline registers and extra control
logic is negligible, how fast could we clock the pipielined BETA? How fast
could we clock it without pipelining, assuming we used the same hardware
for each stage? What's the latency of an operation for the pipelined and
unpipelined BETAs?</P>

<P>Grab that scrap of paper on which you jotted the clock times for the
fractal program running on your BETA for parts 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Since the
BETA for part 1 took exactly 4 cycles per instruction, you can divide the
number for part 4 to figure out how many clock ticks it would have taken
an unpipelined BETA to run the code.  Or, you can rerun Betasim with the
betapath option from Lab 1 and calculate the time directly.</P>

<P>Now, compute the time it would have taken an unpipelined BETA and each
of your four BETAs to execute our sample code. What is the speedup of the
fully bypassed pipelined BETA over the unpipelined vanilla BETA?</P>

<p>Cool, no?</p>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">A note on working with Betasim:&nbsp; Save
