<B><h2>Problem 1: Explicit Parallelism</h2>
</B><FONT SIZE=-1>After two straight all-nighters spent working on his Beta design, Ben Bitdiddle
rushes off to his final ADU lecture. Only moments into his discussion
the professor’s lecture wonders off onto some tangent about how the Ferengi
from Star Trek would be the ideal cache managers. Ben’s concentration suddenly
to fails him. Within seconds Ben falls into a deep sleep.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ben awakens to find that 20 years and, more importantly,
40 semesters have passed since he last made his way to class. As his head
clears he realizes that he is still sitting in an ADU lecture. Even stranger,
Ben comes to recognize the both the stale jokes and thinning curly locks
of the esteemed lecturer<FONT FACE="Symbol">&frac34;</FONT> Professor (now
Emeritus) Pratt.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Little has changed. The canonical programming example
used is still a recursive factorial routine. However, the implementation
is slightly different than Ben remembers.</FONT>

<DIR><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>int factorial(int n) {</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>return facthelp(1, n);</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>}</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>parallel int facthelp(int from,
int to) {</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>int mid;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>if (from >= to) return from;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>mid = (from + to)/2;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>return (facthelp(from, mid)
* facthelp(mid+1, to));</FONT></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignoring the parallel keyword,
how many times is the facthelp( ) function called for a given value of
n? How does this compare to the version from twenty years earlier (shown
below)?</FONT></DT>

<BR>&nbsp;
<P>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>int factorial(int n) {</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>if (n > 0)</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>return n*fact(n-1);</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>else</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>return 1;</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=-2>}</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ben soon realizes that the new factorial routine is intended
for an explicitly parallel machine. The professor explains that the parallel
functions are assigned to processors and executed in parallel with the
function that calls them. The caller function is considered the parent
processor and the parallel functions are its children. When the parent
requires the result of one or more children to make further progress it
automatically stalls and waits.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben remembers that the old version
of the factorial function that he was taught ran in O(n) cycles. What is
the execution-time complexity of the new parallel&nbsp;&nbsp; factorial
function?</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the factorial algorithm given
suited for implementation on a SIMD processor? Explain.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the programming language extension
described best suited for implementation on a SIMD or MIMD parallelism?
Explain.</FONT></DL>
