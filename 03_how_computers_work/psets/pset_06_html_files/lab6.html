<h1>
Lab 6: Controlling a VM system</h1>
In this lab, you are responsible for writing a virtual memory controller.
You will be designing the interrupt handler for page faults. This includes
maintaining a two level hierarchical page table and swapping pages into
and out of memory. The end goal is to use your code to control an actual
system using the FPGA kits. To ease debugging, however, we provide you
with beta code that simulates a machine which is described in detail later.
For parts I-III, you will be using Betasim to develop and test your handler.
Once your code is working, in part IV you will use a FPGA kit to execute
your code and see the effects of page faults.

Part I - Creating the page table:
The target machine has 1K RAM and a 4K disk. Each is segmented into 16-word
pages. To use the entire disk as a swap space, at least ten bits are required
for addressing. The goal of this exercise is to create a two-level page
table with 12-bit addressing. The easiest way to do this is to resolve
four bits at a time, using the four least significant bits as the index
into the page. A TLB is provided to you which maintains dirty and valid
bits for each page in memory, so you don't have to worry about them. However,
you will probably want to use resident bits or something equivalent.
<p>Before proceeding with the implementation, take a minute to create a
diagram of how you would perform an address translation, with reference
to the data in the tables. Once you know how to do this, the next step
is to add this design to <a href="vmtemplate.uasm">vmtemplate.uasm</a>.
Load the file in Betasim and browse through the beginning of the file.
At the top of the file are macro definitions corresponding to the virtual
versions of Beta instructions. Next are the initial contents of memory.
You will be adding your fault hander code here later, part of which is
written for you. Memory page 15 is designated as the level one lookup table.
If you decide to move this to another page, it is essential that you physically
move the table to the new page slot, since the page labels must point to
increasing memory addresses for the simulator to work properly.
<p>Immediately following this is the disk.&nbsp; Put second level address
translation tables here making sure that each page consists of exactly
16 words and is not offset. You should create a page for the kernel code
and pages for the remainder of the disk. There is a program and data preloaded
that performs a heapsort on 32 numbers. You should ensure that the program
has a contiguous address space. Once you have finished this, go back and
update the top-level translation table to point to the second level tables.
Keep your address translation diagram handy...you will need it for the
next part. There is no checkoff for this part.
<h2>
Part II - Writing the fault handler:</h2>
The remainder of vmtemplate.uasm is code provided to you to emulate the
effects of branching, jumping, loading, and storing using virtual addresses.
If you wish, you may look through the code, but you should not modify any
of it. Each of the new opcodes are 0x20 less than the original with a 'V'
appended to the name (LDV, JMPV, ...).&nbsp; LDV and STV also provide a
few extra functions that provide disk communication using negative I/O
addresses.
<p>By performing a STV instruction to address -1, a page is copied from
disk to memory. The least significant four bits refer to the target memory
page. The next eight refer to the physical disk page (only six are used,
however, since you only have 4K). Finally, the next 12 refer to the virtual
page number of the selected page. This is loaded into an internal TLB that
compares
the virtual page number against the address of any memory access to determine
which physical memory page contains the data. Thus, if you write 0x0000E127
to location -1, disk page 18 will be copied to memory page 7 and contains
the data represented by addresses of the form 0x00E?. When the page is
loaded, the valid bit is set and the dirty bit is cleared.
<p>Similarly, a STV instruction to address -2 performs a copy from memory
to disk. The data is segmented in the same fashion, so storing 0x0000E127
to location -2 would copy the page above back to the disk. When the page
is saved, the dirty bit is cleared.
<p>A STV to address -3 clears the valid bit of the page referred to by
the four least significant bits.
<br>A STV to address -4 clears the dirty bit of the page referred to by
the four least significant bits.
<p>A LDV of address -0xP1 returns the valid bit of page P.
<br>A LDV of address <B>-0xP2</B> returns the dirty bit of page P.
<B>CORRECTION!</B>
<p>Now you are equipped to begin writing the page fault handler. Recall
that an interrupt causes PC+1 to be stored in XP and the PC to be set to
2. It is important that you begin your code there. Remember that the address
in XP will be a virtual address, not a physical one. If you want to access
memory at that location, you must use the virtual instructions...LD will
return garbage. Beware, the reason the interrupt was generated in the first
place may be because XP-1 points to a page on disk, so performing a LDV
would fail.
<p>Thus, the first thing needs to be done is determining if the interrupt
was caused by a LDV or STV to a page not in memory, or if a BRV or JMPV
instruction caused the PC to move to a page not in memory. If XP-1 is not
in memory, the PC was on a page not in memory and must be loaded. If it
is, the target address for the LD/LDR/ST instruction needs to be calculated,
and the corresponding page loaded. Since this is not the focus of the assignment,
we provide you with code to do this.
<p>This code will provide a "savedxp" of a virtual address that needs to
be translated. Fill in the function resolvexp to dereference this address
to a physical location. If it is in memory, return to the provided code.
If it is not, load the page and branch to RestoreState. Call loadpage whenever
you need to load a page from disk.
<p>Now you must write loadpage to complete the handler. First, choose some
page in memory to replace, and copy the new page from disk to memory. Remember
that if the replaced page is dirty, it must be written back to disk first.
You should ensure that it is returned to the same location on disk from
which it was read. The easiest page replacement strategy to use is FIFO.
You are not expected to implement anything fancier than this.
<p>To run your code, update any affected page tables, change the first
line to jump to the appropriate (virtual) address, and provide the virtual
address of the start of the data to the heapsort program. These are initially
marked as errors, marked in yellow.
<p>It may be helpful to take the basic translation diagram you created
in part I and expand it with the different cases that can occur (i.e. the
second level translation page is not in memory, etc.) Break things down
into smaller steps and do each individually. This part can become very
complicated and difficult to debug if you take on everything at once. Once
everything is working, running your program should cause two immediate
page faults: one to load the appropriate second level page and one for
the first page of code. If the simulator doesn't branch to the first page
properly, make sure you provide the appropriate virtual address tag to
the TLB as described in STV -1.
<p>Once everything is working, try running the program. Branching to main
should immediately generate two page faults, to load the first page of
the program. If everything works properly, pages will be swapped in and
out of memory as necessary. Add a HALT() after the first section of the
heapsort (update the virtual pointer to data if necessary). The data should
be rearranged as:

Once you have everthing working, compare the number of page faults for
having 3, 4, and 5 swapable pages.&nbsp; If your kernel code and data exceeds
11 pages, you can cheat by not labelling some of the pages.&nbsp; Also,
try it for 32 and 64 elements.&nbsp; What trends do you notice?&nbsp; Why?

You should attempt the lab before reading this section. Some of these points
address subtle issues that will likely just confuse you if you haven't
thought about details of the implementation. Also, some of the concerns
