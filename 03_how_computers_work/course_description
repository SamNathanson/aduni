Includes the basics of digital logical design, computer organization
and architecture including assembly language, processor design, memory
hierarchies and pipelining. Students examine the detailed construction
of a very simple computer.  Problem sets use <i>Beta-Sim</i>, a RISC simulator
written by Mike Wessler.  A higher level view of a modern RISC
architecture is studied, using the Patterson and Hennessey
introductory text, from both the programmer's point of view and the
hardware designer's point of view. The distinction between RISC and
CISC architectures is emphasized.
