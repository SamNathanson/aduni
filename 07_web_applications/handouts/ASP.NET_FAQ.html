<H1>ASP.NET FAQ </H1>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Where can I find sample code?</B> <BR><BR>Check out <A 
  href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/">GotDotNet</A> for some QuickStart tutorials. 
  Another useful reference is <A href="http://www.ibuyspy.com/">IBuySpy</A> 
  where they have a fully-documented sample store web site. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Why does Internet Explorer ask to download a file when I try to view my 
  aspx page?</B> <BR><BR>This is because IIS does not recognize aspx pages yet. 
  To fix this: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Right click on My Computer and select Manage. 
    <LI>Right click on Default Web Site and select properties. <BR>Services and 
    Applications -&gt; Internet Information Services -&gt; Default Web Site 
    <LI>Click on the Home Directory Tab 
    <LI>Click the Configuration button. 
    <LI>Click on Add. 
    <LI>Browse and find the file called <B>xspisapi.dll</B>. It should be at 
    C:\WINNT\Microsoft .NET\Framework\v1.0.2204\xspisapi.dll . Make sure you are 
    looking for dll files and not exe files or you won't find it. 
    <LI>Type aspx in the extension field and click Ok 
    <LI>Ok everything and you should be all set! Happy coding. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>How do I create my first project?</B> <BR><BR>Under new projects, 
  Visual C# Projects, select Web Application and type: 
  <I>http://localhost/my-project-name </I>where my-project-name is whatever name 
  you want. 
  <P>To view your page, you need to <B>Build</B> it first. <BR>You can find your 
  page at http://localhost/my-project-name/page-name.aspx in IE. </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>How do I create index.html in my root folder using Visual Studio?</B> 
  <BR><BR>If you followed the instructions above, you project will be in a 
  folder under the root directory but won't the root directory itself. So in 
  short you can't really do it in Visual Studio. However, you can easily make an 
  index.html in notepad or any other text editor and create a link to a index 
  page in your project directory. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Why aren't my files in my project? Did I lose them?</B> <BR><BR>If you 
  created a file outside of Visual Studio, you will need to add the file to your 
  project in VS so that it can be built and used (applies only to aspx &amp; C# 
  files). To see all the files in your project directory, just click on the Show 
  All Files button in your Solution Explorer. If the file is grayed out then it 
  is not included in the project. To include the files, right click on them and 
  select Include in Project. Remember to build to see it work! 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>How do I add new files to my project?</B> <BR><BR>Right click on your 
  project name in Solution Explorer and then select Add. Generally you will want 
  to create a new Web Form (.aspx) and remember to name it something. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Do all my files have to have .aspx extensions?</B> <BR><BR>If your file 
  has asp tags then your pages will need to have a .aspx extension. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Where is my error log?</B> <BR><BR>You can find your log file here: 
  c:\winnt\system\logfiles\w3svc\date.txt<BR>However this file only logs who has 
  visited your site and not errors generated on your page. You can ignore this 
  part for your problem set if you are working in .NET. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>How do I get the current date and time?</B> <BR><BR>.NET has a DateTime 
  object. To see how it is used, check out the .NET reference documentation that 
  can be found from your start menu. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>How do I pass form data between pages?</B> <BR>There are quite a number 
  of ways to do this and depending on the task at hand, you would probably want 
  to use a different method. If you are thinking of passing form data to another 
  page for Ex 3 it's actually not necessary, you can place it all in one page. 
  <OL>
    <LI>QueryString - Put it in the URL <BR><BR>In the button onclick event, you 
    can Response.Redirect to another page placing the variables in the URL. 
    <BR><BR>
    <TABLE bgColor=#ffffcc>
      <TBODY>
      <TR>
        <TD>e.g. <BR>String strURL = String.Concat("results.aspx?name=", 
          txtName.Text, "&amp;age=", 
          txtAge.Text);<BR>Response.Redirect(strURL);<BR><BR>Then on your 
          results.aspx page you can call Request.Params["name"] to get the name 
          and Request.Params["age"] to get the parameters. 
    </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR>
    <LI>Session - Save it a for awhile <BR><BR>In the button onclick event, you 
    can save all your variables into the Session and then call Response.Redirect 
    to another page that extracts the values from the Session again.<BR><BR>
    <TABLE bgColor=#ffffcc>
      <TBODY>
      <TR>
        <TD>e.g.<BR>Session["name"] = txtName.Text;<BR>Session["age"] = 
          txtAge.Text;<BR>Response.Redirect("results.aspx");<BR><BR>Then on your 
          results.aspx page you can create variables to retreive the value of 
          the Session variables like:<BR>String strName = 
          Session["name"].ToString();<BR>String strAge = 
          Session["age"].ToString();<BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR>
    <LI>Server.Execute - Fake a page change <BR><BR>You can see an example of 
    this at <A 
    href="http://aduni.org/file-storage/testform.aspx">testform.aspx</A>. 
    <BR>The second page testresult.aspx then calls Request.Params["txtName"] to 
    recover the value. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>How do I screen scrape?</B> <BR><BR>For Ex 4 you will need to rip stuff 
  off some other pages. <BR><BR>HttpWebRequest hwr = (HttpWebRequest) 
  WebRequestFactory.Create(strUrl);<BR>StreamReader strm = new 
  StreamReader(hwr.GetResponse().GetResponseStream()); <BR><BR>You can then 
  parse the stream using a Regular Expression. </LI></OL>
